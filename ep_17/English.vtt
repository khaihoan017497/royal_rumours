00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.910
Come in.

18
00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:57.310
Master Yun.

19
00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:58.360
While you were recovering

20
00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.440
at His Highness's place,

21
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.000
Qing Yue disappeared

22
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.110
and

23
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.000
his belongings in his room

24
00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:06.470
were looted

25
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.670
one night.

26
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:08.670
Master Yun.

27
00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.520
It was my negligence,

28
00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:11.990
please punish me.

29
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:13.640
It's not your fault.

30
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:15.390
Master Yun.

31
00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.110
When will you be back?

32
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.800
I'm almost healed.

33
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.800
I'll be back tonight.

34
00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.040
You may leave.

35
00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.150
Yes, Master Yun.

36
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.240
(Who could be behind)

37
00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.040
(Qing Yue's disappearance?)

38
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.550
(And who took all the things)

39
00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.240
(from his room?)

40
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.800
(If it was His Highness,)

41
00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.800
(why didn't he just ask me?)

42
00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.320
(But if it was master,)

43
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.710
(why did he stay put?)

44
00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.020
(The Capital)

45
00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:56.200
Move.

46
00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:59.200
Make way.

47
00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:00.830
Get out of the way.

48
00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:02.080
Move.

49
00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:03.390
- Who is that princess?
- Move.

50
00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.430
- She's a show-off.
- Make way.

51
00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.480
Even our royal family

52
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:07.640
- are not as arrogant as this.
- Move.

53
00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:08.520
- Maybe
- Move.

54
00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.640
- she's a princess from another state.
- Make way.

55
00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.760
- We shouldn't bother
- Move.

56
00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:13.590
with these

57
00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.200
- ignorant petty states.
- Get out of the way.

58
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.520
Hold on.

59
00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.590
They are wearing

60
00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:19.590
the same outfit as us.

61
00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:20.040
You're right.

62
00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.320
How dare you insult our princess!

63
00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.800
Little girl.

64
00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.240
Mind your own business.

65
00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:31.430
Do you know

66
00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:32.990
who is inside the carriage?

67
00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:34.110
I don't know.

68
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:34.960
All I know is that

69
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.240
the States Assembly is coming

70
00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.360
and no one shall oppress the people.

71
00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.640
What's going on?

72
00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.540
(Princess Le Yang)

73
00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.270
This is ridiculous.

74
00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.760
Who is so bold

75
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.390
to block my way?

76
00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.920
I am a marshal under
the command of Marquis Chang'an.

77
00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.870
I'm in charge of

78
00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.800
the States Assembly with Princess Hua.

79
00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.480
It's my duty to maintain order.

80
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.830
Who does Wei Mingyue think she is?

81
00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.830
This is the capital,

82
00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:08.590
not Qinghan Prefecture.

83
00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.550
You...

84
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.920
Drive her away.

85
00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.960
Don't go soft.

86
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.550
Yes.

87
00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.710
What is the penalty for

88
00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.200
assaulting people in the street?

89
00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:19.440
Princess Hua.

90
00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:20.830
Offenders to remove their trousers

91
00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.470
and be publicly flogged ten times.

92
00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.520
In serious cases, they will
be sent to the border

93
00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.120
to serve hard labour for five years.

94
00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:27.520
Take him down

95
00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:28.880
and send him to the capital

96
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.030
for flogging.

97
00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.710
Let him learn

98
00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:32.830
the laws of our state.

99
00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.030
Who on earth are you?

100
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.080
Beat them.

101
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.560
Yes.

102
00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.270
How dare you defy me!

103
00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:56.560
Guards.

104
00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:57.390
Go!

105
00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.760
His Highness has arrived.

106
00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:08.880
Aunt Le Yang.

107
00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:10.640
Your Highness.

108
00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.000
I haven't seen you for a year.

109
00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.120
You're a lot more handsome now.

110
00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:17.320
Your men

111
00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:19.000
don't seem to know
the laws of this state.

112
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:20.590
So I'll send them to

113
00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.470
learn about it at the palace.

114
00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.320
You don't mind, right?

115
00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:30.590
I am grateful to you

116
00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.150
if you are willing to

117
00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:33.200
help me educate

118
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.880
my unruly servants.

119
00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.200
Didn't my daughter say

120
00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:43.120
she wanted to see His Highness?

121
00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.590
Go and get her.

122
00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:45.780
(Why do I feel like someone is)

123
00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:47.140
(staring at me?)
She should greet His Highness.

124
00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.910
Yes.

125
00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:57.200
(Xie Yao)

126
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.710
(is indeed a beauty.)

127
00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:01.790
Your Highness.

128
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.820
(Prince Consort Xie's daughter, Xie Yao)
It's been a while.

129
00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:04.580
(Prince Consort Xie's daughter, Xie Yao)

130
00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:06.080
(Yaoyao?)

131
00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:09.150
Nice to see you again.

132
00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:11.560
Your Highness.

133
00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:13.440
It's our bad.

134
00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:15.520
We've been away for so long

135
00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.150
and we're unfamiliar with the capital.

136
00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:19.320
That's why

137
00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:20.520
we accidentally upset

138
00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:21.320
those two big sisters.

139
00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:22.580
(Who is your big sister?)

140
00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:24.120
They blocked our way.

141
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:25.350
Your Highness.

142
00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:26.760
When did the capital

143
00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:28.230
become so formidable?

144
00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.470
Wait.

145
00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:32.680
What did you say?

146
00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:34.270
Big sister?

147
00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:37.320
Who were you talking about?

148
00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:39.120
I was referring to

149
00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:41.030
the two big sisters next to you.

150
00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:45.680
They are younger than you.

151
00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:47.470
Don't get it wrong.

152
00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:51.760
If there's anything

153
00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:52.960
I've done wrong,

154
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.200
please tell me.

155
00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:56.520
I don't want you

156
00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:58.640
and His Highness to get the wrong idea.

157
00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.560
(How dare she steal my lines!)

158
00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.680
Don't worry.

159
00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.230
So you and His Highness

160
00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:07.470
are old acquaintances.

161
00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:09.470
I can't believe

162
00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:10.520
you take me for

163
00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.200
such a small-minded person.

164
00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:13.560
Yes,

165
00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:15.150
His Highness and I

166
00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:16.790
are indeed old acquaintances,

167
00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:21.390
but since my sister's death,

168
00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:23.440
I've rarely had the chance

169
00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:24.960
to see His Highness.

170
00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:26.790
Your Highness.

171
00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:28.760
Would you

172
00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:30.120
like to show me

173
00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:31.150
around the capital?

174
00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:34.520
Sorry.

175
00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:37.520
I don't have the time.

176
00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.120
I need to send Princess Hua home.

177
00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:43.830
Princess Hua.

178
00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:45.000
Let's go.

179
00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:53.960
That girl just now

180
00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:55.910
turns out to be Wei Mingyue's daughter.

181
00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:59.270
That dumb Wei Mingyue

182
00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:00.350
has raised

183
00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:02.030
a rude daughter.

184
00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:04.030
Mother, calm down.

185
00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:05.710
You are good for nothing.

186
00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:07.230
If it was your big sister...

187
00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:11.320
Now that you have a rival,

188
00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:13.960
you must try to win His Highness's heart,

189
00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:14.880
you understand?

190
00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:16.120
Yes, mother.

191
00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:18.790
I've just returned.

192
00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:21.000
So the Empress Dowager

193
00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:22.910
will give me some dignity.

194
00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:25.200
I'll give you another chance.

195
00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:27.030
Do you hear me?

196
00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:29.320
Yes, mother.

197
00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:37.980
(Blossoming Wealth)

198
00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:52.380
(Hua Mansion)

199
00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:54.680
Your Highness.

200
00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:58.750
You are so kind.

201
00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:00.230
How so?

202
00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:02.710
You are not biased toward Lady Xie.

203
00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:04.320
I am very happy.

204
00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:05.920
Why should I be partial to her?

205
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:07.630
You are my person.

206
00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:15.590
Why don't you sit over at my house?

207
00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:16.350
Didn't you say

208
00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:17.960
you liked the environment of my home?

209
00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:22.960
But when I think of General Hua...

210
00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:25.460
I am not good at drinking.

211
00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:26.800
I'm afraid your parents

212
00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:28.160
will find it inconvenient.

213
00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.470
They won't.

214
00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:30.990
Your Highness.

215
00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:32.280
Honey.

216
00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:39.160
(Hua Mansion)

217
00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:39.870
General Hua.

218
00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:41.590
General Wei.

219
00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:44.590
Your Highness.

220
00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:47.280
It is indeed inconvenient.

221
00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.200
Changkong is preparing for his exam.

222
00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:51.830
He really needs

223
00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:52.870
some peace and quiet.

224
00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:54.960
So we can't

225
00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.110
entertain you today.

226
00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.560
You are right.

227
00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:04.110
Then I'll leave first.

228
00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:12.470
Stop looking.

229
00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:23.140
(Hua Mansion)

230
00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:23.940
Mother.

231
00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:25.440
I was the one who invited

232
00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:26.830
His Highness to our home.

233
00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.160
Wasn't it a bit too rude of you

234
00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:29.750
to turn him down like that?

235
00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:30.870
I've been thinking about it

236
00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.200
over the past two days.

237
00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:33.400
His Highness

238
00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:34.590
is really a nice guy.

239
00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:37.870
Liuli.

240
00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:39.560
Come with me.

241
00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:43.040
Go ahead.

242
00:10:58.110 --> 00:10:59.990
You didn't learn
your father's strengths,

243
00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:02.080
instead, you picked up

244
00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:03.830
all the tricks he used

245
00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:06.230
to please people.

246
00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:08.200
I didn't.

247
00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:10.350
Are you sure?

248
00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:13.560
Did you please His Highness

249
00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:15.320
because you like him?

250
00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:20.200
Mother, what are you talking about?

251
00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:22.280
Liuli.

252
00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:24.200
Look at me.

253
00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:27.040
Let me ask you.

254
00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:28.630
Do you see him

255
00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.440
as a man

256
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:34.080
or a friend?

257
00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:37.440
Mother, stop it.

258
00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:39.040
Let's talk about something else.

259
00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:44.440
I was too busy

260
00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:45.590
with the war

261
00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:47.990
and neglected to interact with you.

262
00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:49.990
I have a question for you

263
00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:52.560
and I want you to answer me properly.

264
00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:56.110
If your brother

265
00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:58.040
was with another woman,

266
00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:00.560
would you be angry?

267
00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:03.440
Why would I?

268
00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:05.630
However,

269
00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.440
I will see if that woman

270
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:09.710
qualifies to be my sister-in-law.

271
00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:14.510
But what if

272
00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:16.320
His Highness

273
00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:18.200
was with another woman?

274
00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:19.560
No way.

275
00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:20.710
Then that woman

276
00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:22.350
will end up like this walnut.

277
00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:27.040
Liuli.

278
00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:30.680
You are ambitious.

279
00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:33.350
What do you mean?

280
00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:39.040
Besides being a renowned

281
00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:40.040
delicate woman,

282
00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:43.040
do you want to be
the mother of a nation?

283
00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:43.990
Mother.

284
00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:45.710
A future Empress?

285
00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:47.320
I'm not that capable.

286
00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:50.200
Then you have to remember one thing.

287
00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:51.710
If His Highness

288
00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:53.960
does not confess his feelings first,

289
00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.110
you must not reveal yours to him

290
00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:57.470
in advance.

291
00:12:57.630 --> 00:12:59.590
He is the Crown Prince after all.

292
00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:02.230
I don't understand.

293
00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:04.710
What do you mean by confessing?

294
00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:08.710
A smile and excitement
that can't be concealed.

295
00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:11.040
Uncontrollable gestures.

296
00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:13.920
Irresistible affection.

297
00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:33.160
I see.

298
00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:36.800
Liuli.

299
00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:40.800
Liuli.

300
00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:46.870
I wish I could

301
00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:48.230
let you go

302
00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:49.440
and pursue your love,

303
00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:51.750
but it's not that easy

304
00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:53.680
to start a family.

305
00:13:56.460 --> 00:14:00.540
(Ceremonial Hall)

306
00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:02.220
Greetings, ministers.

307
00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:04.440
Greetings, Princess Hua.

308
00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:05.160
Today,

309
00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:06.630
we will learn some etiquette.

310
00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:07.510
First,

311
00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:09.350
Luoxia's cheek-to-cheek greeting.

312
00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:11.960
Turn your body towards each other,

313
00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:13.350
extend your arms,

314
00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:14.510
hold each other tightly,

315
00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:16.870
look into each other's eyes

316
00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:18.320
and keep smiling.

317
00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:20.110
Greet.

318
00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:25.280
Next one is

319
00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:27.470
Zhi's handshake.

320
00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:29.710
Face each other.

321
00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:31.630
The host must reach out

322
00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:32.800
to the guest first.

323
00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:34.590
Pay attention to the strength.

324
00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:36.920
Men can be gentle with women.

325
00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.280
Don't shake the whole hand.

326
00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:41.110
Just the tips of the fingers.

327
00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:44.080
Keep smiling and bow.

328
00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:47.590
Try it.

329
00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:49.110
Yes.

330
00:14:58.960 --> 00:14:59.560
It's fine.

331
00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:00.830
I am not that fragile.

332
00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:02.680
I don't need support.

333
00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:03.750
I can come down by myself.

334
00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:07.280
Your Highness.

335
00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.630
The western suburb is
surprisingly crowded.

336
00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:11.630
Thank you

337
00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:12.960
for bringing me here today

338
00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:13.960
for a walk.

339
00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:15.800
It wasn't my intention.

340
00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:17.470
It was actually father's
and grandmother's orders.

341
00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:19.040
I had to comply with them.

342
00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:20.160
Lady Xie.

343
00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:21.990
Don't take it to heart.

344
00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:26.920
Hold each other's hand.

345
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:28.040
Look at each other.

346
00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:29.320
Keep smiling.

347
00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:30.800
Don't hold the whole hand.

348
00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:31.920
Just the tips of the fingers.

349
00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:32.510
That's it.

350
00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:35.040
Be mindful of the distance.

351
00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:35.960
Don't hit your head.

352
00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:36.990
Miss.

353
00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:38.440
Miss.

354
00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:42.830
His Highness is taking Lady Xie

355
00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:43.800
out for a stroll.

356
00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:47.990
(I'm working here)

357
00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:49.560
(and you're out there
having a good time.)

358
00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:03.200
So pretty.

359
00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:07.280
Grow old together?

360
00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:12.900
(Hua Mansion)

361
00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:14.220
(Hua Mansion)
(I wonder what Liuli is doing now.)

362
00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:15.920
It smells good.

363
00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:16.960
(Her carriage is not here.)

364
00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:18.960
(She's probably working
at the Ceremonial Hall.)

365
00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:22.200
Delicious.

366
00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:23.470
Your Highness.

367
00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:27.510
Your Highness.

368
00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:29.230
This is very delicious.

369
00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:29.990
Try it.

370
00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:32.160
What is this?

371
00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:34.960
Your Highness.

372
00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.040
This is a rabbit skewer.

373
00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:37.400
It is made from rabbit meat,

374
00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:38.830
infused with wine, sauce

375
00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:39.590
peppercorns

376
00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:40.870
and then scalded with hot water.

377
00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:42.320
It tastes delicious.

378
00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:44.040
Rabbit meat?

379
00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:45.710
Why didn't you say it earlier?

380
00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:47.510
I...

381
00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:53.200
(She was gentle a moment ago.)

382
00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:56.870
Rabbit meat is good.

383
00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:57.990
It's fresh.

384
00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:00.080
- (She's a totally different person.)
- I really like

385
00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:01.400
this unique flavour.

386
00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:02.740
I see.

387
00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:05.360
You only have a few customers.

388
00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:07.640
Is it because they're
afraid to eat this?

389
00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:09.990
No.

390
00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:12.360
Hasn't Princess Hua

391
00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:14.400
ever considered

392
00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:15.840
your subsistence?

393
00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:18.880
Your Highness.

394
00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:20.310
Your Highness.

395
00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:21.600
Your Highness, please forgive me.

396
00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:22.840
For people like us,

397
00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:24.310
who have no skills,

398
00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:25.550
harvesting and hunting

399
00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:27.160
are how we make a living.

400
00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:28.920
Princess Hua gave us

401
00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:30.030
the recipe for rabbit skewers

402
00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:30.710
so that we could

403
00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:31.680
run a stall here

404
00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:32.840
and finally

405
00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:34.270
earn a living.

406
00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:35.920
She gave you the recipe,

407
00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:37.680
but didn't she consider

408
00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:39.400
the fact that no one
would dare to eat it?

409
00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:40.920
(She's picking on me.)
I...

410
00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:41.840
No.

411
00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:43.440
My business is doing well.

412
00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:45.400
Your Highness.

413
00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:47.990
Enough. Please rise.

414
00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:50.400
Don't worry.

415
00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:52.230
You did very well.

416
00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:56.200
The western suburb was
originally a deserted area,

417
00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:57.920
but it was only through
the initiative of Princess Hua

418
00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:59.200
that it came to be

419
00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:00.070
as lively as it is today.

420
00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:02.510
This site is closely
linked to Longjing Street.

421
00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:04.160
After the States Assembly,

422
00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:06.400
you needn't worry

423
00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:07.600
about making a living.

424
00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:09.440
Thank you, Your Highness.

425
00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:10.920
I am very grateful.

426
00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:22.200
(Men are worthless.)

427
00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:26.310
Your Highness.

428
00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:28.510
Where are you going?

429
00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:33.750
Lady Xie.

430
00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:35.200
I've already walked you

431
00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:36.230
down the street.

432
00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:38.120
Qi, Ba.

433
00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:38.640
- Yes.
- Yes.

434
00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:40.710
If Lady Xie wants to go anywhere else,

435
00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:42.550
go with her.

436
00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:43.510
- Yes.
- Yes.

437
00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:45.180
- Your Highness.
- Lady Xie.

438
00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:46.060
- Lady Xie.
- Lady Xie.

439
00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:47.440
- There's a nice stall over there.
- Yes.

440
00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:49.750
- You will like it.
- Lady Xie, please.

441
00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:53.310
Liuli.

442
00:18:56.550 --> 00:18:57.270
Mister.

443
00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:58.550
Bring me mature vinegar, rice vinegar,
white vinegar, balsamic vinegar,

444
00:18:58.600 --> 00:18:59.600
all of them.

445
00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:00.310
Sure.

446
00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:03.790
Then you have to remember one thing.

447
00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:05.510
If His Highness

448
00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:07.790
does not confess his feelings first,

449
00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:09.750
you must not reveal yours to him

450
00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:11.360
in advance.

451
00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:13.990
He is the Crown Prince after all.

452
00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:19.180
(Vinegar)

453
00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:20.550
I heard that

454
00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:22.310
you were busy at the Ceremonial Hall.

455
00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:23.200
Why are you back?

456
00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:24.070
I want to drink vinegar.

457
00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:34.680
So sour.

458
00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:37.600
Yuan Wei.

459
00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:41.880
They all said that

460
00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:43.310
His Majesty is going to betroth

461
00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:44.470
Lady Xie to you.

462
00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:48.440
How come I didn't know?

463
00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:52.600
Your Majesty, drink slowly.

464
00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:58.640
Father.

465
00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:04.230
You have to help me this time.

466
00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:05.510
What's the matter?

467
00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:10.600
I suddenly realised that

468
00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:13.440
I am a beast.

469
00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:16.960
Did you assault a woman?

470
00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:18.880
Is that

471
00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:20.160
what I am to you?

472
00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:22.160
No.

473
00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:24.030
My son is talented

474
00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:25.120
and good-looking.

475
00:20:26.030 --> 00:20:28.440
He would never do
such an unlawful thing.

476
00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:30.440
So don't ever try to betroth

477
00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:31.360
Princess Le Yang's daughter,

478
00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:32.400
Lady Xie,

479
00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:33.880
to me anymore.

480
00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:35.680
I have no feelings for her.

481
00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:39.160
San Cai.

482
00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:40.510
Yes, Your Majesty.

483
00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:42.990
Did I ever say that?

484
00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:45.710
Your Majesty,

485
00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:48.200
you did mention it before.

486
00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:50.960
Then tell me.

487
00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:52.790
Who do you like?

488
00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:58.680
Well...

489
00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:03.440
Well,

490
00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:05.680
I...

491
00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:07.790
Why are you stammering?

492
00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:09.270
Just tell me.

493
00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:10.400
Who do you like?

494
00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:14.470
You know her.

495
00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:17.310
Who?

496
00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:20.120
Hua Liuli.

497
00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:24.680
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

498
00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:26.790
I almost

499
00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:28.360
betrothed her to your brother.

500
00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:30.680
So how far have you

501
00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:31.920
progressed?

502
00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:34.750
I think

503
00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:37.200
she likes me as well.

504
00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:40.310
She was even jealous of

505
00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:41.230
Lady Xie today.

506
00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:42.750
Then have you ever

507
00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:45.120
confessed your feelings to her?

508
00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:47.470
Not yet.

509
00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:52.160
It seems you are not committed to her.

510
00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:52.840
I think

511
00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:55.750
you'd better marry Xie Yao.

512
00:21:57.070 --> 00:21:57.750
No.

513
00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:01.160
Father.

514
00:22:01.790 --> 00:22:03.070
That Xie Yao

515
00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:04.270
is so pretentious.

516
00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:05.710
One minute she's soft,

517
00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:06.750
one minute she's sobbing,

518
00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:08.270
the next she's acting cute.

519
00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:09.680
My head hurts

520
00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:11.070
when I hear her talk.

521
00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:14.840
Why do I feel that

522
00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:16.880
you are talking about Hua Liuli?

523
00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:18.200
Father.

524
00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:19.990
You can't say that about Liuli.

525
00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:23.120
Tell me.

526
00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:27.400
How can I help you?

527
00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:31.510
Just don't randomly
arrange a marriage for me.

528
00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:51.180
(Graceful House)

529
00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:51.750
Miss.

530
00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:52.880
Don't worry.

531
00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:53.920
His Majesty has sent

532
00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:55.640
several physicians to examine him.

533
00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:57.680
Grand Preceptor Du will be fine.

534
00:22:58.400 --> 00:22:59.880
I still need to study medical books.

535
00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:01.880
Maybe I can help with

536
00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:02.840
grandfather's illness.

537
00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:08.680
(I wonder why Young Master Yun)

538
00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:10.310
(came to see me at this time.)

539
00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:11.470
Cai Wei.

540
00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:13.030
Get me a basin of water.

541
00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:14.510
Yes, Miss.

542
00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:30.920
How are you, Lady Du?

543
00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:33.360
I'm fine.

544
00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:35.920
Young Master Yun.

545
00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:38.640
How is your wound healing?

546
00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:40.070
It has recovered,

547
00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:41.600
thanks to your help

548
00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:42.920
in those few days.

549
00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:47.070
This is a thank-you gift.

550
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:48.750
Please accept it.

551
00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:54.030
I heard that Grand Preceptor Du

552
00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:55.310
had been in poor health recently.

553
00:23:56.510 --> 00:23:58.160
So I chose a picture of a pine tree,

554
00:23:58.310 --> 00:24:00.400
in hope it will bring good luck.

555
00:24:04.270 --> 00:24:05.710
Thank you, Young Master Yun.

556
00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:09.780
(Chen Daoxi)

557
00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:14.160
This is Master Chen's handwriting.

558
00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:16.230
This is too valuable.

559
00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:17.470
I can't take it.

560
00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:18.680
I don't appreciate it

561
00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:20.230
even if it were in my place.

562
00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:21.640
You should keep it.

563
00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:28.270
Thank you, Young Master Yun.

564
00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:35.070
You can

565
00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:36.600
see the other one after I leave.

566
00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:43.400
I'll take my leave then.

567
00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:24.470
Your Highness.

568
00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:27.200
If my guess is correct,

569
00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:28.680
this is the poison Qing Yue used

570
00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:30.310
to control Yun Han.

571
00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:33.160
Qing Yue

572
00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:34.120
was doing his master's

573
00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:34.920
dirty work.

574
00:25:35.030 --> 00:25:36.160
Now that he is dead,

575
00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:37.200
the man cut off

576
00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:38.400
his contact with Yun Han directly.

577
00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:41.160
At least Yun Han is
safe for the time being.

578
00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:43.160
Are you sure?

579
00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:44.680
Your Highness.

580
00:25:45.270 --> 00:25:46.070
Now that we've

581
00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:47.030
gotten this far.

582
00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:48.790
We just need to uncover one more lead

583
00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:49.470
and we will

584
00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:50.510
wipe them out.

585
00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:53.270
We have to ask Yun Han face-to-face.

586
00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:54.160
If I were to do that,

587
00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:56.030
it would be no different from

588
00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:56.510
controlling someone with poison.

589
00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:57.200
Then Yun Han...

590
00:25:57.270 --> 00:25:57.840
Jihuai.

591
00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:04.030
I don't want to be

592
00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:05.230
the one who pushes him off the cliff.

593
00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:08.470
I want to save him,

594
00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:09.990
not force him.

595
00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:10.960
Your Highness.

596
00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:12.160
But you are also

597
00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:12.840
on the edge of a cliff.

598
00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:13.640
You are wrong.

599
00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:15.920
I gave my trust to Yun Han

600
00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:18.030
because we are in the open.

601
00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:19.960
That being the case,

602
00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:21.990
I'll take the risk.

603
00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:22.790
Your Highness.

604
00:26:24.030 --> 00:26:24.840
You may leave.

605
00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:28.310
Yes, Your Highness.

606
00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:52.120
(Yun Han.)

607
00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:53.840
(How could you)

608
00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:55.310
(betray His Highness?)

609
00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:05.820
(Dafu Jewelry)

610
00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:07.680
If you see something you like, tell me.

611
00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:08.790
I'll buy it for you.

612
00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:10.270
Mother.

613
00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:11.960
Didn't you tell me to spend wisely?

614
00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:14.200
Fortune is not

615
00:27:14.270 --> 00:27:15.960
a substitute for happiness.

616
00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:19.230
I'm happy these days.

617
00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:21.640
I know.

618
00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:23.550
It's because of Princess Le Yang,

619
00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:24.200
isn't it?

620
00:27:25.550 --> 00:27:27.510
She's used to being
arrogant and domineering.

621
00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:28.640
Now someone

622
00:27:28.790 --> 00:27:30.360
can finally confront her.

623
00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:32.750
Liuli is such

624
00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:33.960
a nice lady.

625
00:27:34.270 --> 00:27:35.070
She has

626
00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:36.680
the flair of General Wei in her day.

627
00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:38.510
You need to hang out with her more.

628
00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:39.790
Pick a few pieces of
jewelry for her, too.

629
00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:41.960
But it's expensive.

630
00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:43.680
Then pick fewer for yourself

631
00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:44.880
and buy more for her.

632
00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:48.030
This is not bad.

633
00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:49.470
This phoenix hairpin

634
00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:51.360
is mine.

635
00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:57.710
I thought it was someone else.

636
00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:59.470
So it's you, Le Yang.

637
00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:01.440
You just grab others' stuff

638
00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:02.790
and steal it when you can't get it.

639
00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:03.960
As expected of you.

640
00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:04.840
Why aren't you

641
00:28:05.030 --> 00:28:06.440
educating your daughter at home?

642
00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:09.030
My little sister.

643
00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:10.640
I haven't seen you in over a year

644
00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:12.160
and the way you speak

645
00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:13.440
is still so unflattering.

646
00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:16.600
No wonder you don't even

647
00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:17.960
have the title of Princess Imperial

648
00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:19.030
at your age.

649
00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:20.550
You...

650
00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:22.920
My little sister.

651
00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:24.920
Are you getting mad at me again?

652
00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:27.360
I remember that

653
00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:28.200
you were rejected by father

654
00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:29.600
because you lost your temper with me

655
00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:32.470
and he caught you

656
00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:34.920
in a disgraceful manner.

657
00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:38.710
Get out of here.

658
00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:42.960
Whenever I see you

659
00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:44.550
get mad at me

660
00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:46.230
and unable to do anything about it,

661
00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:49.360
I feel

662
00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:52.750
sorry for you.

663
00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:53.470
You...

664
00:28:53.710 --> 00:28:54.120
You...

665
00:28:58.030 --> 00:28:58.510
Mother.

666
00:28:58.680 --> 00:28:59.750
Mother, are you all right?

667
00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:01.030
Are you...

668
00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:04.710
Princess Shun'an, are you all right?

669
00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:06.270
I'm fine.

670
00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:08.750
Your Highness.

671
00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:11.550
If you like this hairpin,

672
00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:13.120
just say it.

673
00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:15.160
Princess Shun'an is a generous person.

674
00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:17.230
She'll definitely buy it for you.

675
00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:18.990
Why would you

676
00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:21.030
hit her?

677
00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:21.640
You...

678
00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:24.030
You are sisters.

679
00:29:25.030 --> 00:29:25.600
When did I hit her?

680
00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:26.510
She didn't.

681
00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:26.960
Cry.

682
00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:28.840
- I didn't even move my hands.
- Cry now.

683
00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:30.070
She started it first.

684
00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:37.680
Mother.

685
00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:40.680
Mother, are you all right?

686
00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:42.960
Aunt.

687
00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:44.310
My mother is your little sister.

688
00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:45.960
You are older than her.

689
00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:47.990
How could you hit her

690
00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:51.120
when she was so tolerant of you?

691
00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:53.600
Nonsense!

692
00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:55.680
When did I hurt your mother?

693
00:29:56.790 --> 00:29:58.710
Jiamin.

694
00:30:00.030 --> 00:30:00.790
I know

695
00:30:00.990 --> 00:30:02.840
we are not welcome,

696
00:30:03.270 --> 00:30:03.960
but

697
00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:05.990
you can't just make things up.

698
00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:08.790
You guys are too much.

699
00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:10.880
Princess Shun'an.

700
00:30:11.270 --> 00:30:12.990
Why don't you see a physician?

701
00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:15.440
I think it's swollen here.

702
00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:16.230
Really?

703
00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:18.880
Mother.

704
00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:21.510
I'll tell His Majesty.

705
00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:25.030
Mother.

706
00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:26.200
Jiamin.

707
00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:27.750
Bring it on.

708
00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:29.510
I'm not afraid.

709
00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:34.030
Your Majesty, please do me justice.

710
00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:35.880
Mother has gone to rest,

711
00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:38.510
and you are here making trouble.

712
00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:40.880
So, what's wrong now?

713
00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:43.120
Brother.

714
00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:45.840
They made things up.

715
00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:48.310
I have a witness.

716
00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:52.120
Bring the guard here.

717
00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:02.750
Greetings, Your Majesty.

718
00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:04.640
Let me ask you.

719
00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:07.510
Did you see me hit her?

720
00:31:08.030 --> 00:31:08.920
Your Majesty,

721
00:31:09.030 --> 00:31:09.640
no.

722
00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:12.600
Your Majesty.

723
00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:15.600
Please do me justice.

724
00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:18.230
He's your own servant.

725
00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:19.990
Of course he's taking your side.

726
00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:22.990
Your Majesty.

727
00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:24.470
I have evidence.

728
00:31:24.990 --> 00:31:25.680
Look.

729
00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:27.920
You...

730
00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:30.750
Please do me justice.

731
00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:33.070
How dare you frame me!

732
00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:34.160
I will...

733
00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:35.070
Stop.

734
00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:36.200
This is ridiculous.

735
00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:40.200
Your Majesty.

736
00:31:40.790 --> 00:31:43.640
I'm still grieving

737
00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:45.600
for Chan.

738
00:31:46.270 --> 00:31:48.640
That's why I was out of line.

739
00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:51.640
Please punish me.

740
00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:52.750
I have heard this

741
00:31:52.790 --> 00:31:53.790
countless times.

742
00:31:58.120 --> 00:31:58.960
Princess Hua.

743
00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:02.880
Yes, Your Majesty.

744
00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:04.600
You were there.

745
00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:06.470
What do you think?

746
00:32:07.470 --> 00:32:08.360
Your Majesty.

747
00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:10.200
I believe that

748
00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:11.790
Princess Le Yang

749
00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:12.960
has her own reason.

750
00:32:13.070 --> 00:32:14.360
That's justifiable.

751
00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:17.550
So she does not need to be punished.

752
00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:19.880
Still, you can't let

753
00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:21.030
Princess Shun'an

754
00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:22.230
suffer for nothing.

755
00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:23.710
I think

756
00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:25.160
you should step in

757
00:32:25.230 --> 00:32:26.840
to make amends to Princess Shun'an.

758
00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:33.070
Brother.

759
00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:37.070
How about this?

760
00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:39.070
Shun'an.

761
00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:41.030
You are not young anymore.

762
00:32:42.270 --> 00:32:44.990
I'll make you a Princess Imperial.

763
00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:45.750
What do you think?

764
00:32:48.990 --> 00:32:50.840
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

765
00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:02.470
(Hua Liuli again.)

766
00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:04.360
(Hua Liuli again.)

767
00:33:09.550 --> 00:33:10.640
Thank you for today.

768
00:33:10.790 --> 00:33:11.310
Thank you.

769
00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:12.510
Don't mention it.

770
00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:15.550
My mother's wish

771
00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:16.790
was to become the Princess Imperial

772
00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:18.310
and now she has finally gotten her wish.

773
00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:19.840
It all thanks to you.

774
00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:22.070
Princess Jiamin.

775
00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:23.160
You misunderstood.

776
00:33:23.230 --> 00:33:24.920
I didn't do anything.

777
00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:26.600
Fine.

778
00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:27.790
Go ahead and pretend.

779
00:33:29.230 --> 00:33:30.550
How did you make my mother's cheek

780
00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:31.640
so red?

781
00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:32.160
Yes.

782
00:33:32.270 --> 00:33:33.400
Will it fade?

783
00:33:33.510 --> 00:33:34.880
It's a blush.

784
00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:37.710
Blush?

785
00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:40.640
By the way,

786
00:33:41.030 --> 00:33:42.310
is it because they offended you

787
00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:43.640
that you took action?

788
00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:45.710
Am I that much of

789
00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:47.230
a grudge-holder?

790
00:33:47.510 --> 00:33:48.440
Minmin.

791
00:33:48.510 --> 00:33:50.920
Liuli was doing justice.

792
00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:53.470
You should learn from her.

793
00:33:53.790 --> 00:33:54.270
Let's go

794
00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:55.270
and eat something delicious.

795
00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:55.840
Let's go.

796
00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:58.230
I can't believe His Majesty.

797
00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:00.270
How could he make her
the Princess Imperial?

798
00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:01.790
I'm so pissed off.

799
00:34:03.790 --> 00:34:04.880
She'll cook for you.

800
00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:07.160
Hua Liuli, stop right there.

801
00:34:07.470 --> 00:34:08.470
Stop pretending.

802
00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:12.400
Xie Yao.

803
00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:14.590
Why are you being so harsh?

804
00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:17.550
You were not like this before.

805
00:34:18.110 --> 00:34:18.960
Listen.

806
00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:19.960
His Highness

807
00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:21.440
will marry me.

808
00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:22.760
I am the daughter of a princess.

809
00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:24.590
I will soon be crowned Crown Princess.

810
00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:25.760
My father

811
00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:27.280
is also the head of
the Southern Civil Service.

812
00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:30.880
Your family has resigned.

813
00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:32.670
His Majesty is not pleased.

814
00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:34.960
Your glory is on the wane.

815
00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:36.280
His Highness will definitely

816
00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:37.590
make the right choice.

817
00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:39.590
Don't listen to her nonsense.

818
00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:41.150
We all know that the Hua family

819
00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:42.320
has been loyal for generations.

820
00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:43.440
My father also said that

821
00:34:43.630 --> 00:34:45.550
His Majesty will reinstate General Hua.

822
00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:46.880
Yes.

823
00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:48.760
I can testify to this.

824
00:34:50.590 --> 00:34:51.840
Thank you, Princess Shun'an

825
00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:53.760
and Jiamin.

826
00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:55.280
You are so kind.

827
00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:02.670
Xie Yao.

828
00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:03.720
What are you

829
00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:05.150
trying to do with all this talk?

830
00:35:06.070 --> 00:35:07.510
If you're just trying to make

831
00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:08.800
a harsh statement,

832
00:35:09.070 --> 00:35:10.070
then don't waste your time.

833
00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:11.190
I misread you.

834
00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:12.060
You...

835
00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:13.470
Hua Liuli, shut up!

836
00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:14.990
Aren't you afraid that

837
00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:16.110
when His Highness comes,

838
00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:17.550
you won't even have time to pretend

839
00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:19.550
before His Highness
sees your true colour?

840
00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:21.440
Aren't you pretending too?

841
00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:24.590
You got me wrong.

842
00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:26.960
I'm naturally beautiful

843
00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:27.960
and delicate.

844
00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:29.670
Why do I need to pretend?

845
00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:33.920
The decree is here.

846
00:35:37.590 --> 00:35:39.880
My mother and I have been bullied by you

847
00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:41.920
since we arrived in the capital.

848
00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:45.030
You guys are too much.

849
00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:51.320
Princess Hua, please receive the decree.

850
00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:57.400
I accept the decree.

851
00:35:58.110 --> 00:36:00.280
By order of His Majesty,

852
00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:02.760
the Hua family has
achieved great success

853
00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:04.320
and has been loyal for generations.

854
00:36:04.510 --> 00:36:06.760
Princess Hua has served the people

855
00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:08.400
with great dedication.

856
00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:11.550
Hence, she will be
crowned Crown Princess,

857
00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:13.800
with the title of Fushou.

858
00:36:15.630 --> 00:36:16.990
What title?

859
00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:18.440
Fushou.

860
00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:19.720
Wishing you

861
00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:22.470
a long and blessed life.

862
00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:25.360
Congratulations, Princess Fushou.

863
00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:27.070
(That's an awful name.)

864
00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:28.800
I am grateful to His Majesty.

865
00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:31.400
Long live the Emperor.

866
00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:48.960
What is His Majesty's intention?

867
00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:50.920
I asked him every day

868
00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:52.240
to reward my daughter,

869
00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:53.960
but he didn't.

870
00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:55.320
Instead, he actually rewarded

871
00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:56.590
Wei Mingyue's daughter.

872
00:36:57.110 --> 00:36:58.440
Honey, please calm down.

873
00:36:59.030 --> 00:37:01.400
His Majesty has his own considerations.

874
00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:03.150
What considerations could he have?

875
00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:05.190
He just wants to humiliate me.

876
00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:07.070
He's humiliating me!

877
00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:07.840
Honey.

878
00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:09.840
The walls have ears.

879
00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:13.920
It's your fault!

880
00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:15.880
Get out of here! Now!

881
00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:19.800
You're worthless, too.

882
00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:21.240
Your sister

883
00:37:21.470 --> 00:37:23.280
would never embarrass me like this.

884
00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:30.070
I know you have a grievance.

885
00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:32.720
I will order someone to
send some scriptures.

886
00:37:33.190 --> 00:37:34.320
You can read them

887
00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:36.400
to calm your mind and concentrate.

888
00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:41.470
I knew you would say that.

889
00:37:42.550 --> 00:37:44.920
I want you to kill them for me.

890
00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:46.960
Kill them!

891
00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:48.720
Why did you say

892
00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:50.760
such a treacherous thing?

893
00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:52.760
What are you pretending for?

894
00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:54.470
Aren't you keeping

895
00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:55.590
assassins all along?

896
00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:57.400
Go.

897
00:37:57.800 --> 00:37:58.920
Kill them for me.

898
00:37:59.510 --> 00:38:01.070
Kill them.

899
00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:03.070
I want them all dead!

900
00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:09.110
It's better not to know

901
00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:11.720
what you shouldn't know.

902
00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:13.880
And don't say

903
00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:15.960
what you shouldn't say.

904
00:38:22.990 --> 00:38:24.630
Do you hear me?

905
00:38:26.590 --> 00:38:28.670
Xie Linzhou, you...

906
00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:29.990
Honey.

907
00:38:30.190 --> 00:38:31.760
The States Assembly is coming soon.

908
00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:33.280
Envoys from various states will come.

909
00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:34.400
It will be crowded.

910
00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:36.440
You should stay home and not go out

911
00:38:36.510 --> 00:38:37.400
for the time being.

912
00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:39.550
And don't worry.

913
00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:41.960
The Hua Family is in charge
of the States Assembly.

914
00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:42.900
They have their own

915
00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:44.150
problems to deal with.

916
00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:50.110
You should stay

917
00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:52.300
and look after your mother, too.

918
00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:19.220
(Ceremonial Hall)

919
00:39:34.070 --> 00:39:35.070
Greetings, Minister Hua.

920
00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:38.280
You are here.

921
00:39:38.670 --> 00:39:39.550
Please sit down.

922
00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:46.400
Minister Hua.

923
00:39:46.990 --> 00:39:48.720
You should take a break

924
00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:50.280
before attending to official duties.

925
00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:51.150
You've been

926
00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:52.510
working too hard these past few days.

927
00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:54.960
The States Assembly is a big event.

928
00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:56.630
We can't afford any mistakes.

929
00:39:58.360 --> 00:39:59.150
Minister Zhang.

930
00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:01.110
Anything happened today?

931
00:40:01.630 --> 00:40:03.800
The envoys of
the Dianzhu are vegetarian.

932
00:40:04.070 --> 00:40:05.070
I have replaced

933
00:40:05.150 --> 00:40:06.320
all their meals and provisions

934
00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:07.720
with vegetarian dishes.

935
00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:10.800
The Mosi envoys were not happy

936
00:40:11.070 --> 00:40:12.320
when a citizen

937
00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:13.590
gave them the thumbs up

938
00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:15.400
while they were strolling around.

939
00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:17.760
We have sent people to reassure them

940
00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:21.190
and explain to them as you instructed.

941
00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:22.070
Thank you.

942
00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:23.590
Minister Hua.

943
00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:25.030
And one more thing.

944
00:40:25.110 --> 00:40:26.440
I don't know if it's significant.

945
00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:27.550
Tell me.

946
00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:30.720
The Jinpo envoys

947
00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:33.240
have not yet arrived.

948
00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:36.320
The main focus of this assembly

949
00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:37.880
is the negotiations to end the war

950
00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:39.070
with Jinpo.

951
00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:41.590
There is still

952
00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:43.440
no news from them.

953
00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:46.550
Who will Jinpo send this time?

954
00:40:47.590 --> 00:40:49.360
I was told that

955
00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:51.960
it was He Yuanting,
the second prince of Jinpo.

956
00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:54.320
He Yuanting

957
00:40:54.470 --> 00:40:56.280
was a strong contender

958
00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:57.800
for the Crown Prince's throne.

959
00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:00.280
Somehow he lost his favour

960
00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:02.840
and disappeared from Jinpo

961
00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:04.280
for a while.

962
00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:06.630
Jinpo doesn't seem to be

963
00:41:08.190 --> 00:41:09.550
taking our negotiations very seriously

964
00:41:09.630 --> 00:41:11.280
by sending him this time.

965
00:41:14.590 --> 00:41:15.590
Don't worry.

966
00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:17.630
He will definitely come.

967
00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:20.630
We have to get ready.

968
00:41:24.140 --> 00:41:26.820
(Pretentious Hour)

969
00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:32.070
Minmin.

970
00:41:32.190 --> 00:41:33.880
Look, a new storybook.

971
00:41:35.590 --> 00:41:37.190
Where did you get this ugly doll from?

972
00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:38.920
It looks like Prince Ying.

973
00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:40.320
Let's go to Jinling Garden

974
00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:41.360
and see Yun Han.

975
00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:43.360
But he doesn't

976
00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:44.320
show up much these days.

977
00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:45.670
Shall I go to see the Crown Prince?

978
00:41:46.110 --> 00:41:46.920
Don't mention His Highness

979
00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:47.720
or Yun Han.

980
00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:48.150
I warn you.

981
00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:49.550
If you mention
Prince Ying again, I will...

982
00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:52.670
Fine.

983
00:41:54.070 --> 00:41:55.920
Is it my eyes problem

984
00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:57.670
or your eyes problem?

985
00:41:57.720 --> 00:41:59.030
I don't know if your eyes

986
00:41:59.110 --> 00:41:59.670
are good or not.

987
00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:01.510
Anyway, I only have eyes for...
