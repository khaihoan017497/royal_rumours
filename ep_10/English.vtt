Throw it away.

18
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.010
Hua Liuli.

19
00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.480
How long has she left?

20
00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.050
Your Highness.

21
00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.450
It has been a few days.

22
00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.330
I wonder if she is

23
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.480
causing any trouble out there.

24
00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:42.680
Thank you.

25
00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.730
Miss.

26
00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.450
You have a weak body,

27
00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.010
yet you insist on coming personally

28
00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.050
to greet the people.

29
00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.730
Your Highness.

30
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.050
I heard that the people

31
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.450
are having a bad time.

32
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.610
I must come over to visit them.

33
00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.640
Princess Hua came to visit us.

34
00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.010
Look.

35
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.010
Thank you, Princess Hua.

36
00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.680
You didn't see it just now.

37
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.290
She has been talking to us for a while.

38
00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:03.730
She cares about our life.

39
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:05.640
Is there any place

40
00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.450
for Miss to sit?

41
00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:08.760
Prince Ying.

42
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.290
Can we borrow your seat for a while?

43
00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:12.480
You don't mind, do you?

44
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.520
I think...

45
00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:15.200
Thank you.

46
00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.240
Thank you.

47
00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:17.200
His Highness is a kind person.

48
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.640
Let's go.

49
00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.330
Miss has been working hard

50
00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.480
for the past few days.

51
00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.010
Her body can barely hold it.

52
00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:31.640
Yuan Wei.

53
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.920
Being able to contribute to the people,

54
00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.570
I would never find it hard.

55
00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.960
Please be mindful, Your Highness.

56
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:39.960
She is trying to enjoy
the fruits of others

57
00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.960
in your territory without having toiled.

58
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.010
Last time, I rode
a horse on a busy street

59
00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:46.130
and was taught

60
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.360
a harsh lesson.

61
00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:48.960
I'm a smart person.

62
00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:50.170
How can I

63
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.330
fall for the same trick?

64
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:01.050
Princess Hua.

65
00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.610
Would you like some water?

66
00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:07.640
Thank you, Your Highness.

67
00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:14.450
Princess Hua.

68
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.650
If you don't wish to participate

69
00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:17.730
in this contest,

70
00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:19.850
you don't have to work that hard.

71
00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:20.850
You can let me

72
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.050
suffer the hardship alone.

73
00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.970
Since your body is weak.

74
00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:25.440
Even if you slack off a bit,

75
00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.170
the people won't criticise you.

76
00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.050
Do you agree with what I say?

77
00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.850
Do you really think so?

78
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:32.610
Of course.

79
00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:33.970
I am serious about it.

80
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:35.290
Your Highness.

81
00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.120
Have you ever heard of this?

82
00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.530
Givie a man a fish and
you feed him for a day.

83
00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.530
Teach a man to fish and
you feed him for a lifetime.

84
00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.240
This saying came from a chapter in
Huainanzi, the Discourse on Forests.

85
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.680
It was written by Liu An,
the Prince of Huainan.

86
00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.120
The original text says,

87
00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.480
"If you stand by the river and
want the plump fishes in the water,

88
00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.650
it is better to go home
to weave a fishing net.

89
00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.650
The pearl..."

90
00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.770
(Although I dislike Prince Ying,)

91
00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:01.480
(he is not a bad person in nature.)

92
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.240
"The paws of a tiger
and the tusks of an elephant

93
00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.360
are beneficial for the beasts
but harmful for me."

94
00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:07.560
Your Highness.

95
00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:09.480
Since you've heard of that,

96
00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:11.320
you will understand that

97
00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.360
what you're doing now is

98
00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.000
like drinking poison to quench thirst.

99
00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:17.880
When you provide
free food to the people,

100
00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.090
the people who were hardworking

101
00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:21.440
know that they can

102
00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:22.680
get free food here.

103
00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:24.970
Who would want to work?

104
00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:26.680
Are you going

105
00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:28.360
to give away free food for a day

106
00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.850
or forever?

107
00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:31.170
Yuan Wei.

108
00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.050
Let's go in front.

109
00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.730
Let's go.

110
00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.120
Be careful.

111
00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:45.560
What does that mean?

112
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.050
Did you see that?

113
00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:48.360
Princess Shun'an

114
00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.880
and Minister Tian

115
00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:51.170
are competing

116
00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.850
to be the owner of this house.

117
00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:56.880
Drink poison to quench thirst.

118
00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:57.440
Look.

119
00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:01.530
So these are

120
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:03.090
the cause of their problems.

121
00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.850
Yes, Your Highness.

122
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.210
Many farmers

123
00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.480
live near the market in the capital.

124
00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:08.560
Their business was good.

125
00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:09.440
I am of the opinion that

126
00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:10.560
if you wish

127
00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:11.440
to teach a man to fish.

128
00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:12.730
We need to think of some ways

129
00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:13.680
to help them.

130
00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:16.530
You're right.

131
00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.650
Instruct the painters

132
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.170
to paint my portraits properly.

133
00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:22.410
The better the painting,
the greater the reward.

134
00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:23.170
Yes.

135
00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:30.820
♪The spring breeze carries
the song away♪

136
00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:35.180
♪The mountain and river
is incomparable to you♪

137
00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:38.120
Who is this?

138
00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:39.850
Minmin, walk slowly.

139
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.320
Prince Ying is here?

140
00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:43.120
No. It's Hua Liuli.

141
00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:44.240
I was following

142
00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.000
Hua Liuli.

143
00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.770
I happened to see him.

144
00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:47.440
Madam.

145
00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.120
What is Prince Ying doing?

146
00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:50.240
How would I know?

147
00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:51.410
I thought he was

148
00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:52.970
giving away free food again.

149
00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:54.050
Do you know what he's doing?

150
00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.440
Farmer Assistance Program
at Longjin Street.

151
00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:56.410
He wants me to pay

152
00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:57.560
for a wax gourd.

153
00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:58.770
The free gift is Prince Ying's portrait.

154
00:06:58.880 --> 00:06:59.680
Who would want that?

155
00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:00.920
Yes.

156
00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.170
Take it easy.

157
00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:07.090
Keep it for me. Hurry.

158
00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:07.730
Stupid Hua Liuli.

159
00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:08.320
Keep it.

160
00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.120
Minmin, please don't run.

161
00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:11.170
It's settled then.

162
00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:12.480
It's a deal. Princess Hua.

163
00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:13.050
Street officer,

164
00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:15.440
I'm buying all these.

165
00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:17.880
Thank you for coming, Your Highness.

166
00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:20.560
What are you doing here this time?

167
00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:22.530
Greetings, Your Highness.

168
00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:24.000
What a coincidence

169
00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:25.440
to see you everywhere I go.

170
00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:27.650
Your Highness.

171
00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:29.050
I'm sorry.

172
00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.170
All these items

173
00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.240
have been bought

174
00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:32.360
by Princess Hua.

175
00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:33.410
What?

176
00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:34.360
Your Highness, did you come

177
00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:35.440
to buy these products, too?

178
00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:36.410
Then,

179
00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:37.730
I can let you

180
00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:38.560
have these products.

181
00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:40.560
It's a waste seeing these products

182
00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:42.120
being kept long in stock.

183
00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:42.410
Yes.

184
00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:43.410
So I bought them.

185
00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:44.920
Even so,

186
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.850
they might end up rotten.

187
00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:47.610
It's all right.

188
00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:48.730
Since you have made the offer,

189
00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:49.970
you can have them.

190
00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:52.560
All right.

191
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:53.730
Street officer.

192
00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:55.000
We'll follow the agreement.

193
00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:55.680
Yes. No problem.

194
00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:56.360
Later I'll ask

195
00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:57.410
Song to pick up the products.

196
00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:57.970
Sure.

197
00:07:58.050 --> 00:07:59.210
(Ji Yuanhao)
I'll make the preparation later.

198
00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:02.770
As for Prince Ying's portraits,

199
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.170
why don't I

200
00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.210
give them to you?

201
00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:09.650
Who would want that?

202
00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:12.240
Princess Hua.

203
00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:13.320
Let me show you the products.

204
00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:13.850
Let's go.

205
00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:14.680
Goodbye.

206
00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:20.920
No. What are you doing?

207
00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:22.610
Since your father and my father

208
00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:23.560
support Prince Ying,

209
00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:24.440
this is part of

210
00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:25.360
our responsibilities.

211
00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:26.480
Bring all these portraits away.

212
00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:28.050
Bring them away?

213
00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:28.610
Yes.

214
00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:29.210
Hurry up.

215
00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:29.610
All right.

216
00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:31.000
Fine.

217
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:31.730
Let's go.

218
00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:32.920
All right.

219
00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:33.840
Let's go.

220
00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:44.890
That was close.

221
00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:46.720
If Jiamin offered a higher price,

222
00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:47.650
the street officer

223
00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:48.800
would definitely have sold

224
00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:49.410
those items I bought on credit

225
00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:51.080
to Jiamin.

226
00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:51.800
Your Highness.

227
00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:53.290
Based on your instruction,

228
00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:54.170
I have sent all those items

229
00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:55.600
to the cellar in the old mansion

230
00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:56.410
in the western suburb.

231
00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.130
They probably won't spoil

232
00:08:58.130 --> 00:08:59.250
anytime soon.

233
00:08:59.320 --> 00:08:59.960
However,

234
00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:02.440
making a purchase on credit
is not a long-term solution.

235
00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:03.490
Don't worry.

236
00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.320
I have a plan.

237
00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:06.650
Really?

238
00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:08.410
Let's borrow some money.

239
00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:10.650
Borrow money?

240
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.170
We're borrowing money
and buying things on credit.

241
00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:13.200
Debts after debts.

242
00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:14.890
Master and Madam will kill me,

243
00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:15.840
Miss.

244
00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.410
Who are we borrowing from?

245
00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:21.650
I'm not telling you.

246
00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:24.370
Miss.

247
00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:26.100
(A'Wa wanted to hold Princess Hua
hostage to threaten the Hua family.)

248
00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:27.500
(He wanted to attack Qinghan Prefecture
but walked into our trap.)

249
00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:31.530
A'Wa has spent quite some time

250
00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.440
in the prison of Supreme Court.

251
00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:36.290
It's time to interrogate him.

252
00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:39.080
Your Highness, speaking of that,

253
00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:39.490
there's something

254
00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:40.600
that I forgot to inform
you, Your Highness.

255
00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:41.170
Say it.

256
00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:43.200
Those assassins from Jinpo

257
00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:44.440
probably think that Princess Hua

258
00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:45.200
can save them.

259
00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:46.250
Even A'Wa,

260
00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:47.680
since the day

261
00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:48.440
he was imprisoned,

262
00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:49.440
has been asking

263
00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:50.320
to meet Princess Hua.

264
00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:52.170
He wants to see Princess Hua?

265
00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:53.170
Yes.

266
00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:54.560
Isn't that solid evidence

267
00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:55.800
of collusion

268
00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:56.840
between Princess Hua and Jinpo?

269
00:09:58.770 --> 00:09:59.440
Go to Supreme Court now.

270
00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:02.320
Kneel!

271
00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:04.800
No way!

272
00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:05.770
Kneel!

273
00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:10.010
Look at your attitude.

274
00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:11.440
Can you really have a peace negotiation

275
00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:12.680
with Jinpo properly?

276
00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:23.080
Do you think you can live

277
00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:25.650
until the day of peace negotiation?

278
00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:33.320
General A'Wa, you might not know that

279
00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.290
I never care

280
00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:36.490
about what people think.

281
00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.560
I only care about my action.

282
00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:41.920
You have been scolding Hua Liuli

283
00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:42.920
in prison every day.

284
00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:44.290
Why?

285
00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:45.840
I scold her

286
00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:46.650
because

287
00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:47.770
I was tricked by her,

288
00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:49.200
but at the same time,

289
00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:50.650
she was tricked by
our Second Prince, too.

290
00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:51.680
What do you mean by that?

291
00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:54.250
Make it clear.

292
00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:55.170
Explain it properly.

293
00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:56.800
That little liar

294
00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:58.010
walked into our Second Prince's

295
00:10:58.050 --> 00:10:58.720
honey trap.

296
00:10:59.200 --> 00:10:59.770
Otherwise,

297
00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:00.530
our Second Prince

298
00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:01.720
would have been caught by you.

299
00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:03.250
Honey trap?

300
00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:05.130
(That sounds like)

301
00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:06.290
(something Hua Liuli would do.)

302
00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:07.490
Hua Liuli

303
00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:09.320
likes our Second Prince very much.

304
00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:11.080
She praised him all the time.

305
00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.130
She raved about him,

306
00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:13.370
but she doesn't know that

307
00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:14.920
our Second Prince endure the humiliation

308
00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.680
to carry out an important task.

309
00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:17.410
That woman

310
00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:18.530
must be mad now.

311
00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:19.410
She wanted

312
00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:20.320
to catch our Second Prince,

313
00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:23.170
but she only managed to catch me.

314
00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:26.080
Jinpo lost the battle.

315
00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:28.080
General A'Wa,

316
00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:29.600
you lost the battle, too.

317
00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:32.290
Who are you to badmouth

318
00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:34.170
the daughter of our general?

319
00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:35.050
Believe it or not,

320
00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:37.010
I can chop your head off now.

321
00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:39.720
You want to kill me? Do it.

322
00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:40.800
I'm going to show you

323
00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.650
the heroic spirit of Jinpo.

324
00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:46.650
General A'Wa.

325
00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:48.720
You probably don't know

326
00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:49.490
something.

327
00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:50.200
What?

328
00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:51.680
You and the five assassins

329
00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:52.600
living next to your cell

330
00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:54.080
serve the same master.

331
00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:56.320
Guards.

332
00:11:57.170 --> 00:11:59.080
Bring General A'Wa back to his cell.

333
00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:00.410
Cut all his meals by half.

334
00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:02.080
Please invite the teacher
from Royal Academy

335
00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:04.010
to teach General A'Wa properly

336
00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:05.680
how a general of a losing country

337
00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:08.200
should speak and act.

338
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:09.800
Why are you cutting down my food?

339
00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:10.600
What do I have to study?

340
00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:11.600
You can't cut down on my food!

341
00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:12.530
I'm not going to study!

342
00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:13.290
Let me go!

343
00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:14.440
I want to fight him!

344
00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:24.840
Your Highness.

345
00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:26.170
You asked me to infiltrate the prison

346
00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:27.010
to gather information,

347
00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:27.800
but you don't have to

348
00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:28.650
really torture me, right?

349
00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:29.410
Why don't you

350
00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:31.010
charge me with a crime first?

351
00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:32.530
Junior Secretary Pei.

352
00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:35.440
You don't gather any intelligence
despite many days of investigation.

353
00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:37.050
You are suspected of treason.

354
00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:39.650
Your Highness.

355
00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:42.490
Being suspected of treason

356
00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:44.530
is a bit too much.

357
00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:46.530
What about the crime of
defending a prisoner of war?

358
00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:47.770
That sounds better.

359
00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:49.170
I appreciate your kindness,
Your Highness.

360
00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:51.960
Since Junior Secretary Pei
does not want to be tortured,

361
00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:53.680
I'll send you over to accompany

362
00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:54.370
the general.

363
00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:55.800
Qi and Ba.

364
00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:56.600
Yes.

365
00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:58.600
Remove Junior Secretary Pei's
official robes

366
00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:00.170
and bring him to prison.

367
00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:00.650
Yes.

368
00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:01.050
No.

369
00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:04.080
Take it easy.

370
00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:07.250
Your Highness.

371
00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.490
Do you need me to find out

372
00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:10.840
the relationship

373
00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:11.290
between the Second Prince of Jinpo

374
00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:12.410
and Princess Hua?

375
00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:12.920
With that,

376
00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:14.080
Your Highness

377
00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:15.250
will have something

378
00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:16.250
on Princess Hua.

379
00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:17.370
She will definitely

380
00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.600
submit to you, Your Highness.

381
00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:21.920
I am aware

382
00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:23.010
of Princess Hua's character.

383
00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:24.250
Qi and Ba.

384
00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:25.410
Junior Secretary Pei.

385
00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:26.490
Let's go.

386
00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:34.060
(Yunzhong Hall)

387
00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:36.250
He Yuanting,
the Second Prince of Jinpo,

388
00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:37.800
wants to kill Princess Hua?

389
00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:41.960
Of course I wouldn't believe in A'Wa.

390
00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:43.130
He's an enemy.

391
00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:45.050
It seems

392
00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:46.080
you trust

393
00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:46.770
Princess Hua a lot.

394
00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:49.320
I want to know your opinion

395
00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:50.650
on He Yuanting.

396
00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:53.490
This person's influence in Jinpo

397
00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:54.960
is similar to your third brother.

398
00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:57.290
His maternal family is not influential.

399
00:13:57.490 --> 00:13:58.560
He's relying on himself

400
00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:00.050
to fight for the throne.

401
00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:03.130
He is good in martial arts

402
00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:04.600
and is capable of leading an army.

403
00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:06.170
Aside from the Crown Prince of Jinpo,

404
00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:07.650
the Second Prince

405
00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:08.920
has the most supporters.

406
00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:40.170
(Second Prince of Jinpo, He Yuanting)
Ever since A'Wa was captured,

407
00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:41.960
Ye Yuanting's reputation in the country

408
00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:43.050
has greatly reduced.

409
00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:45.370
After that,

410
00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:47.170
I heard he went out to travel.

411
00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:49.050
Therefore, the information you gave

412
00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:49.960
wasn't inaccurate.

413
00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:51.960
Hua Army caught A'Wa,

414
00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:53.680
but He Yuanting ran away.

415
00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:57.320
Was that a honey trap
set up by the prince

416
00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:00.320
or the princess?

417
00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:04.050
Miss.

418
00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:04.890
Didn't you say that

419
00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:06.320
your relationship with Crown Prince

420
00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:07.560
has improved?

421
00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.290
He's kept us waiting for so long.

422
00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:10.960
Can we really borrow money from him?

423
00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:13.010
Let's try.

424
00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:14.410
If it doesn't work.

425
00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:15.490
I'll turn to...

426
00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:17.490
I'll turn to...

427
00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:18.920
Who are you going to look for?

428
00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:19.800
You are on bad terms

429
00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:20.530
with many people.

430
00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:21.650
Who is willing to lend money to us?

431
00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:23.200
What do you mean by that?

432
00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:25.050
Princess Jiamin and I

433
00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:26.250
have a good relationship.

434
00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:27.600
Really?

435
00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:31.200
Princess Hua, please wait a moment.

436
00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:32.320
Crown Prince just came back.

437
00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:33.440
He needs to take a bath and get changed

438
00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:34.200
before coming to see you.

439
00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:35.920
Do you see that?

440
00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:38.290
Our relationship is good enough

441
00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:39.920
for him to take a bath and
get changed before meeting me.

442
00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:47.080
It seems we have to

443
00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:48.410
return his favour.

444
00:15:56.890 --> 00:15:57.370
Your Highness.

445
00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:02.080
The colour is too light.

446
00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:05.680
Then, please take a look at this.

447
00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:12.960
This is too formal.

448
00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:15.050
Your Highness, what about this?

449
00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:20.010
This looks a bit immature.

450
00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:21.770
Please take a look at this.

451
00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:29.170
Yuan Wei.

452
00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:30.960
This is good.

453
00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:31.600
When we go home later,

454
00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:32.720
we should buy some.

455
00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:33.320
Yes.

456
00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:36.080
Miss.

457
00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:45.650
(Crown Prince)

458
00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:51.370
(is so...)

459
00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:01.840
Greetings, Your Highness.

460
00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:04.840
Princess Hua.

461
00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:06.080
What are you looking at?

462
00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:08.010
Your Highness, you look great.

463
00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:12.160
Princess Hua, you're knowledgeable.

464
00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:13.930
In your opinion,

465
00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:15.320
if you compare me with
my attendants in the yard,

466
00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:17.360
the musician from Jinling Garden

467
00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:18.970
and that person...

468
00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:21.210
The Second Prince of Jinpo.

469
00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:22.490
(He Yuanting?)

470
00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:23.530
Who do you think is more attractive?

471
00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:26.050
(Why did His Highness mention his name?)

472
00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:27.320
(Could it be...?)

473
00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:30.730
I am not as attractive as others,

474
00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:32.930
but I am very concerned about this.

475
00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:35.290
(Is His Highness sick?)

476
00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:37.400
(That's why he starts
spouting nonsense.)

477
00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:39.290
(What is she trying to do?)

478
00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:41.490
(I am not an unprincipled person.)

479
00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:47.970
(If you're sick, you
should see a physician.)

480
00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:50.400
(Why are you avoiding me?)

481
00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:00.600
Your Highness.

482
00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:03.120
What's with your hand?

483
00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:04.800
Are you wary of me?

484
00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:05.530
No.

485
00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:08.640
I don't mean that.

486
00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:10.880
What are you doing?

487
00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:11.770
No.

488
00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:12.970
Miss.

489
00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:15.490
Are you done?

490
00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:28.290
That's my tea cup.

491
00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:29.050
I...

492
00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:31.010
It was an accident.

493
00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:32.250
(This is awkward.)

494
00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:33.490
(Say something.)

495
00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:34.730
(How did it turn out like this?)

496
00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:36.640
(The tea is still hot.)

497
00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:38.010
We just poured the tea into the cup.

498
00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:44.530
By the way, Princess Hua,

499
00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:45.840
since you wish to become

500
00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:47.450
a Ceremonial Officer in the future,

501
00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:48.560
you must set an example

502
00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:49.560
in front of the People

503
00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:51.210
Prince Ying and you

504
00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:52.640
are competitors now.

505
00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:55.010
If nothing is going on,
you shouldn't meet him.

506
00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:57.210
I have no intention to meet

507
00:18:57.290 --> 00:18:58.250
Prince Ying frequently.

508
00:18:58.840 --> 00:18:59.560
That's great.

509
00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:02.290
Avoid going to places

510
00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:04.450
like Jinling Garden.

511
00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:05.800
Why?

512
00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:07.160
I heard that

513
00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:09.010
many officials

514
00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:10.600
like to go there.

515
00:19:12.970 --> 00:19:14.360
What about you, Your Highness?

516
00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:18.010
I never go to Jinling Garden.

517
00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:20.490
No. I'm asking

518
00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:21.640
whether I

519
00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:23.210
can still meet you, Your Highness?

520
00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:24.840
You're chosen by me.

521
00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:26.360
You have to side with me.

522
00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:27.930
Why shouldn't I see you?

523
00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:29.360
I'm glad.

524
00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:30.930
I promise you, Your Highness.

525
00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:34.210
Since you call me

526
00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:36.050
a part of your fraction,

527
00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:37.050
can you

528
00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:38.880
do me a favour, Your Highness?

529
00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:39.690
What do you need?

530
00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:40.930
A small matter.

531
00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:42.120
I need to borrow some money.

532
00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:43.120
How much do you need?

533
00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:47.140
(Minister Mansion)

534
00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:48.600
I've heard from my father

535
00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:50.800
that Prince Ying is having
a bad time lately.

536
00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:52.320
I heard he turned sluggish lately.

537
00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:53.930
He became sluggish?

538
00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:55.400
The people are probably

539
00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:56.930
not interested in his portraits.

540
00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:58.290
Hua Liuli,

541
00:19:58.320 --> 00:19:59.530
on the other hand,

542
00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:00.560
bought all the people's products.

543
00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:02.490
When they compare the two of them,

544
00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:03.250
they think that

545
00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:04.930
it is better for Prince Ying
to give away free food.

546
00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:06.360
All the people are

547
00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:07.400
praising Hua Liuli now.

548
00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:08.050
Prince Ying

549
00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:09.290
hasn't gone out for a few days.

550
00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:11.450
You...

551
00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:12.800
This is Hua Liuli's fault!

552
00:20:13.450 --> 00:20:14.490
Ouch. This is so painful.

553
00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:16.210
Take it easy.

554
00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:17.050
Wait.

555
00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:18.010
Listen to me.

556
00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:19.050
Say it.

557
00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:19.880
If you dislike

558
00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:21.080
her pretentious manner,

559
00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:22.560
there is no point looking for her now.

560
00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:24.080
Isn't she the villainess

561
00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:25.160
in the storybook?

562
00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:26.400
She has her ways to irritate you.

563
00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:28.560
What should I do?

564
00:20:30.010 --> 00:20:32.080
First, think about who
you are fighting for.

565
00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:32.840
It's for Prince Ying...

566
00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:35.290
It's for myself and my courage.

567
00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:37.450
Yes, you can.

568
00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:39.930
Based on my reading experiences,

569
00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:41.320
there are two ways.

570
00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:42.770
Number one.

571
00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:44.800
The man you care for

572
00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:46.400
is hurt by this woman

573
00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:47.360
and this

574
00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:48.530
is your chance

575
00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:49.320
to get close to him.

576
00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:52.800
What about the other way?

577
00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:54.160
As for the other way,

578
00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:55.290
such a situation rarely appears

579
00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:56.080
in the storybooks

580
00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:57.210
of the State of Jin.

581
00:20:57.490 --> 00:20:58.770
I have read one.

582
00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:00.210
The title is the Story of Xiyu.

583
00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:01.360
The story is about

584
00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:03.120
two girls who hated each other

585
00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:04.450
who become

586
00:21:05.250 --> 00:21:07.450
good friends in the end.

587
00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:10.490
Hua Liuli and me?

588
00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:11.840
How is that possible?

589
00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:14.210
Minmin.

590
00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:16.250
What's wrong?

591
00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:18.730
Don't you believe that I'm broke?

592
00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:21.050
Last time,

593
00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:22.400
you seemed to have a deep pocket.

594
00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:23.530
Was it all an act?

595
00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:25.970
Over the years, I spent all my money

596
00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:27.400
for certain purposes.

597
00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:29.730
All right.

598
00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:33.290
We can always find a way.

599
00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:35.250
We can do it without spending money.

600
00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:36.210
Yuan Wei.

601
00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:37.450
Bring out those things

602
00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:38.320
that we prepared earlier

603
00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:39.770
to show to His Highness.

604
00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:42.860
(Renovation of Longjin Street)

605
00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:45.490
When the envoys arrive
at Longjin Street,

606
00:21:45.730 --> 00:21:46.490
there will be higher demands

607
00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:48.050
for basic necessities.

608
00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:50.770
Hua Mansion happens to be there.

609
00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:52.160
While this area

610
00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:54.120
has some abandoned houses,

611
00:21:54.250 --> 00:21:55.010
I'm of the opinion

612
00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:56.400
that we can use them.

613
00:21:56.770 --> 00:21:57.560
How are we going to use them?

614
00:21:58.320 --> 00:21:59.210
I plan to

615
00:21:59.450 --> 00:22:00.560
turn these abandoned houses

616
00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:01.800
into shops.

617
00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:02.770
Firstly,

618
00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:04.400
the unsold food can be put to use.

619
00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:05.010
Secondly,

620
00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:06.490
those unemployed people can have jobs.

621
00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:07.360
Thirdly,

622
00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:08.490
we can use the place

623
00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:09.690
to entertain the envoys.

624
00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:11.690
Your Highness,

625
00:22:12.050 --> 00:22:13.120
what do you think

626
00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:14.640
about my idea?

627
00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:15.530
It's great.

628
00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:17.120
Please go ahead, Princess Hua.

629
00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:18.120
However,

630
00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:20.320
I have no money.

631
00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:23.290
Since I've seen your effort,

632
00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:25.690
I should show my support, too.

633
00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:27.160
I'm going to borrow you

634
00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:28.250
all my money.

635
00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:30.690
Your Highness, you're a kind person.

636
00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:42.120
(How can he be poorer than me?)

637
00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:49.930
Thank you, Your Highness,

638
00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:52.250
for your support.

639
00:22:58.290 --> 00:22:59.290
Prince Ying.

640
00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:01.320
Have you ever heard of this?

641
00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:02.600
Give a man a fish and
you feed him for a day.

642
00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:04.640
Teach a man to fish and
you feed him for a lifetime.

643
00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:06.360
Are you going

644
00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:07.730
to give away free food for a day

645
00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:09.320
or forever?

646
00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:16.840
Prince Ying, come on.

647
00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:17.970
You haven't lost yet.

648
00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:19.250
How can I

649
00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:20.490
simply give up?

650
00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:23.010
I just don't understand

651
00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:25.160
what it means by teaching a man to fish.

652
00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:26.770
Princess Hua

653
00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:28.690
bought all the people's products.

654
00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:30.970
Is that how she teaches people to fish?

655
00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:33.210
That's because

656
00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:34.730
Hua Liuli is trying
to buy their support.

657
00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:36.690
I was going to do that,

658
00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:38.210
but in the end, she took the credit.

659
00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:39.160
Your Highness.

660
00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:45.250
Censorate Zhu sent a message saying that

661
00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:46.600
Princess Hua seems to be planning

662
00:23:46.770 --> 00:23:48.160
to open a shop on the old street
in the western suburb.

663
00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:49.120
She's going to open a shop?

664
00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:51.530
Let's open a shop, too.

665
00:23:52.450 --> 00:23:53.800
I'm rich.

666
00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:54.930
Let's

667
00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:56.560
have a shop right opposite them.

668
00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:57.490
We'll be selling

669
00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:58.400
whatever they're selling.

670
00:23:58.640 --> 00:23:59.970
Let's compete with them directly,

671
00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:00.690
so that she won't have a chance

672
00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:02.010
to play tricks on us.

673
00:24:02.290 --> 00:24:03.210
Prince Ying.

674
00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:04.120
Please remember

675
00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:05.360
why you joined the candidacy

676
00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:06.120
for the Ceremonial Officer position?

677
00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:07.970
If you give up now,

678
00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:08.880
it is as if you're handing over

679
00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:10.160
all your effort to the other person.

680
00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:11.530
Prince Ying.

681
00:24:12.010 --> 00:24:12.930
Let's open a shop.

682
00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:26.080
Yes.

If you don't do anything,

686
00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:37.290
you'll be losing for real.

687
00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:37.860
No.

688
00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:38.320
Let's go. Hurry up.

689
00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:39.160
What's the hurry?

690
00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:41.210
Let's go.

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:01.800
All right. That's good.

♪We are destined to be together♪

Let's work harder

704
00:25:16.730 --> 00:25:18.600
and beat the opposite shop.

705
00:25:29.770 --> 00:25:30.560
How is it?

706
00:25:30.770 --> 00:25:31.800
Hua Liuli.

707
00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:34.050
You must be surprised.

708
00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:37.730
Initially,

709
00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:39.400
I wanted to borrow some money
from Princess Jiamin

710
00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:40.490
to open a shop.

711
00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:41.800
I never thought

712
00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:43.730
that you would open your shop

713
00:25:43.770 --> 00:25:45.050
in the western suburb.

714
00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:46.400
I never thought

715
00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:47.600
that we'd have

716
00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:48.970
the same thought.

717
00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:52.840
I'm helping Prince Ying.

718
00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:53.880
You should get ready to cry.

719
00:25:57.840 --> 00:25:59.880
Princess Jiamin,

720
00:26:00.010 --> 00:26:02.160
please go easy on me.

721
00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:07.450
Let's go.

722
00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:11.080
Your Highness.

723
00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:12.290
Look at their shop

724
00:26:12.450 --> 00:26:13.450
and look at our shop.

725
00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:14.800
How can you laugh?

726
00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:16.640
It's good for Prince Ying

727
00:26:16.690 --> 00:26:18.640
and Jiamin to open their shop here.

728
00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:20.490
I was worrying about this matter.

729
00:26:21.210 --> 00:26:23.290
They're giving me
the exact thing that I need.

730
00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:24.970
That's great.

731
00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:32.290
All right. Tie it up tightly.

732
00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:33.210
Sure.

733
00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:35.450
Here you go.

734
00:26:35.450 --> 00:26:35.840
Put it here.

735
00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:36.250
Be careful.

736
00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:36.600
Yes.

737
00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:38.080
That place up there...

738
00:26:39.930 --> 00:26:41.050
Miss Yuan Wei.

739
00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:41.360
It is so painful.

740
00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:42.530
Are you all right?

741
00:26:42.970 --> 00:26:43.600
Please help me to get up.

742
00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:44.530
Sure.

743
00:26:45.050 --> 00:26:46.600
Isn't that somebody's loyal follower

744
00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:47.840
or a lovebird?

745
00:26:49.450 --> 00:26:50.490
Please distribute this

746
00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:51.600
everywhere.

747
00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:52.880
We have to let them know

748
00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:53.880
the exact time

749
00:26:53.970 --> 00:26:54.730
of our shop opening.

750
00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:56.490
The western suburb is so far away.

751
00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:57.800
What if nobody comes over?

752
00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:00.010
Princess Jiamin's shop

753
00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:01.010
is here, too.

754
00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:02.050
They choose to open their shop

755
00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:03.250
in this place.

756
00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:04.290
It's far from the crowd as well.

757
00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:05.530
Go ahead. Hurry up.

758
00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:06.560
Miss is going to scold me later
if we don't do as she says.

759
00:27:06.730 --> 00:27:07.600
Yes.

760
00:27:15.010 --> 00:27:17.840
Free transportation. Free tasting.

761
00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:20.930
Hong.

762
00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:23.250
Your Highness, what can I do for you?

763
00:27:23.250 --> 00:27:23.730
Come here.

764
00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:28.930
Go.

765
00:27:28.930 --> 00:27:29.600
Yes.

766
00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:36.640
(Best salary and benefit in the capital)
We're hiring!

767
00:27:36.770 --> 00:27:38.690
Princess Jiamin is hiring.

768
00:27:38.770 --> 00:27:39.450
Everyone will get a chance.

769
00:27:39.530 --> 00:27:41.290
Don't rush. Calm down.

770
00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:43.290
You just have to pay us

771
00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:43.880
the partnership fee.

772
00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:45.050
You will become a part

773
00:27:45.050 --> 00:27:45.880
of Huahua Beverage Shop.

774
00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:46.450
In other words,

775
00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:47.400
I am a shop owner now, right?

776
00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:47.970
Right.

777
00:27:48.010 --> 00:27:48.290
Noted.

778
00:27:48.290 --> 00:27:48.970
If you agree to it,

779
00:27:48.970 --> 00:27:49.880
please sign this.

780
00:27:49.970 --> 00:27:50.560
I agree.

781
00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:50.880
Here you go.

782
00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:51.800
This is way better

783
00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:52.730
than working for others.

784
00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:53.490
Really?

785
00:27:53.530 --> 00:27:54.160
That's great.

786
00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:54.930
This is good.

787
00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:55.400
Thank you.

788
00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:56.050
Here. This is for you.

789
00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:56.970
Next, please.

790
00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:57.880
(Hua)
How do we go about it?

791
00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:58.400
(Hua)
Look.

792
00:27:58.450 --> 00:27:59.640
You just need to pay us

793
00:27:59.690 --> 00:28:00.450
the partnership fee.

794
00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:08.210
Everything I use,

795
00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:09.490
from the tables and chairs

796
00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:10.450
to the tea cups,

797
00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:11.970
must be of the highest quality.

798
00:28:12.210 --> 00:28:12.930
Do you understand?

799
00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:13.800
Yes.

800
00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:15.010
Get the things done.

801
00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:16.250
Yes.

802
00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:23.250
Your Highness.

803
00:28:23.290 --> 00:28:24.600
The eyes are well drawn.

804
00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:25.690
I'm pretty good at this, right?

805
00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:26.800
That's great.

806
00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:27.450
We can put up

807
00:28:27.450 --> 00:28:28.360
the banner later.

808
00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:31.560
I think

809
00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:32.880
you can add some colour over here.

810
00:28:35.490 --> 00:28:36.250
This is cute.

811
00:28:37.530 --> 00:28:39.800
Come and take a look.

812
00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:40.770
Five days later,

813
00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:42.050
free transportation

814
00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:44.080
to Qunying Restaurant
in the western suburb.

815
00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:46.290
Yes. We have free tasting.

816
00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:47.600
It fell on the ground.

817
00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:48.730
Free transportation

818
00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:50.560
to Qunying Restaurant
in the western suburb.

819
00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:52.690
Qunying Restaurant
in the western suburb.

820
00:28:52.690 --> 00:28:53.450
What is this?

821
00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:55.050
Free tasting.

822
00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:55.800
Take it.

823
00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:56.690
Since we're right next to each other,

824
00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:57.250
please come to our shop, too.

825
00:28:57.250 --> 00:28:58.250
Free tasting.

826
00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:08.530
Thank you, everyone.

827
00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:09.690
Thank you, everyone.

828
00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:10.800
Let's celebrate it together.

829
00:29:10.930 --> 00:29:12.490
Thank you, everyone.

830
00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:13.450
Congratulations.

831
00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:21.160
Thank you, everyone.

832
00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:22.250
Congratulations.

833
00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:26.660
(Qunying Restaurant)

834
00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:29.320
What do you think

835
00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:30.210
about the name of this shop?

836
00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:35.500
(Qunying Restaurant)

837
00:29:36.290 --> 00:29:39.050
Yang Cao Restaurant
(Goat and Grass Restaurant)

838
00:29:39.930 --> 00:29:41.160
This name sounds

839
00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:42.930
magnificent.

840
00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:44.730
It's vigorous and graceful.

841
00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:45.690
What a suitable name.

842
00:29:45.930 --> 00:29:46.840
Princess Jiamin.

843
00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:51.450
The name of the shop
is Qunying Restaurant.

844
00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:56.770
This is what happens

845
00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:58.290
if you don't study hard
when you're young.

846
00:30:01.250 --> 00:30:02.800
I hereby

847
00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:04.210
announce

848
00:30:05.050 --> 00:30:06.530
the grand opening

849
00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:08.530
of Qunying Restaurant.

850
00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:09.880
Bravo!

851
00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:15.730
Today,

852
00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:17.010
all the food

853
00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:18.400
are free.

854
00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:19.800
At the same time.

855
00:30:19.970 --> 00:30:22.210
I would like to make an announcement.

856
00:30:22.290 --> 00:30:24.970
All the people of Longjin Street

857
00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:26.770
who were forced to move and got affected

858
00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:27.930
due to the assembly of the envoys

859
00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:29.490
can eat for free forever.

860
00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:31.880
Good!

861
00:30:33.050 --> 00:30:34.290
Why isn't there anyone

862
00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:35.730
from Longjin Street?

863
00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:37.250
I hope that I was born

864
00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:38.290
in Longjin Street.

865
00:30:39.210 --> 00:30:40.210
What's wrong?

866
00:30:40.290 --> 00:30:41.360
Princess Jiamin.

867
00:30:42.250 --> 00:30:43.360
I owe you

868
00:30:43.450 --> 00:30:44.360
one.

869
00:30:44.730 --> 00:30:45.530
In the future,

870
00:30:45.690 --> 00:30:46.840
I will do twice as much in return.

871
00:30:47.690 --> 00:30:49.450
If the shop suffers any losses,

872
00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:51.210
I will absorb it.

873
00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:53.050
I was trying

874
00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:54.010
to teach Hua Liuli a lesson

875
00:30:54.050 --> 00:30:55.360
by using your name.

876
00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:57.210
Please don't get me wrong.

877
00:30:57.450 --> 00:30:59.050
What do you mean by that?

878
00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:06.250
I heard that Prince Ying

879
00:31:06.290 --> 00:31:08.400
was going to marry Princess Hua.

880
00:31:08.730 --> 00:31:11.250
What is Princess Jiamin doing...

881
00:31:12.050 --> 00:31:14.690
Bravo!

882
00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:40.250
Song.

883
00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:40.840
Hurry up.

884
00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:41.560
(Beverage Shop)

885
00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:42.250
(Beverage Shop)
Coming.

886
00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:43.210
Come here.

887
00:31:48.290 --> 00:31:48.800
That's amazing.

888
00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:49.360
Bravo!

889
00:31:51.450 --> 00:31:52.080
Look.

890
00:31:53.970 --> 00:31:55.880
Good!

891
00:31:56.490 --> 00:31:57.560
That's amazing!

892
00:32:15.490 --> 00:32:17.600
I was the one who brought them here.

893
00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:19.530
Tell them about the free tasting.

894
00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:21.320
Free tasting at Qunying Restaurant!

895
00:32:21.530 --> 00:32:25.210
Free tasting at Qunying Restaurant!

896
00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:29.160
Free tasting at Qunying Restaurant!

897
00:32:29.290 --> 00:32:30.530
Free tasting!

898
00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:32.970
Free tasting at Qunying Restaurant!

899
00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:38.080
Good!

900
00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:42.500
(Beverage Shop)

901
00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:44.880
Once you're done tasting
the food for free,

902
00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:46.320
please come over to
the Hua family's Beverage Shop

903
00:32:46.490 --> 00:32:47.530
to drink some beverages.

904
00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:48.320
Is it free?

905
00:32:48.490 --> 00:32:49.490
Is it free?

906
00:32:50.050 --> 00:32:51.320
It's not free.

907
00:32:51.690 --> 00:32:53.120
It's not free.

908
00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:54.530
Although it's not free,

909
00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:55.770
for today,

910
00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:56.880
we have a special promotion.

911
00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:57.640
Really?

912
00:32:57.800 --> 00:32:58.840
This gourd

913
00:32:58.970 --> 00:33:00.160
can be carried around easily.

914
00:33:00.210 --> 00:33:02.600
There's something special about it.

915
00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:03.320
Something special?

916
00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:05.010
Look here.

917
00:33:06.450 --> 00:33:07.080
How is it?

918
00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:08.400
Your Highness.

919
00:33:09.530 --> 00:33:11.450
That's all we have for now.

920
00:33:14.210 --> 00:33:15.250
All right.

921
00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:20.640
You're not allowed to bring
the beverage into the shop.

922
00:33:20.770 --> 00:33:22.600
That wasn't a rule earlier on.

923
00:33:23.290 --> 00:33:24.840
If you want to eat for free,
keep your mouth shut.

924
00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:26.290
Fine.

925
00:33:26.290 --> 00:33:28.320
Please keep it for me.

926
00:33:28.970 --> 00:33:29.880
Come on.

927
00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:31.640
(Chang)
Chang?

928
00:33:32.970 --> 00:33:34.360
Why did Hua Liuli carve a word

929
00:33:34.450 --> 00:33:35.120
on the gourd?

930
00:33:36.050 --> 00:33:37.880
Does anybody have a gourd
with the character "Chang"?

931
00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:39.530
Yes.

932
00:33:40.050 --> 00:33:41.320
"Chang" is here.

933
00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:43.120
Let's go.

934
00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:43.930
No.

935
00:33:44.210 --> 00:33:45.930
What is Hua Liuli doing now?

936
00:33:46.450 --> 00:33:47.120
How is it?

937
00:33:48.250 --> 00:33:49.250
Her strategy

938
00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:50.320
is way better than

939
00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:51.360
those in the storybooks.

940
00:33:52.210 --> 00:33:53.050
She carved a word

941
00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:54.770
on each gourd

942
00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:56.600
and sealed the word with a layer of wax.

943
00:33:56.770 --> 00:33:58.360
Those who bought the beverages

944
00:33:58.450 --> 00:34:00.250
can form different idioms
with the words.

945
00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:01.160
For instance,

946
00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:02.600
the word "Chang" you saw just now

947
00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:05.400
can be combined

948
00:34:05.490 --> 00:34:06.840
for "chang long yong sheng"
[*Eternal prosperity]

949
00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:08.200
With that,

950
00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:09.330
they can redeem

951
00:34:09.370 --> 00:34:10.720
a ceramic doll from the border.

952
00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:22.410
(So cute.)

953
00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:43.720
I want one, too.

954
00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:45.450
(Beverage Shop)

955
00:34:45.450 --> 00:34:46.160
Thank you.

956
00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:47.810
This is so pretty.

957
00:34:47.890 --> 00:34:48.050
Thank you.

958
00:34:48.050 --> 00:34:48.680
Yes.

959
00:34:50.010 --> 00:34:50.930
Wait.

960
00:34:50.930 --> 00:34:51.850
I want to redeem the gift, too.

961
00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:53.080
"Shi shi ru yi"
[*Everything goes well.]

962
00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:54.490
Look. I managed to form an idiom.

963
00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:56.010
Can I pick a doll now?

964
00:34:57.010 --> 00:34:57.640
I'm sorry.

965
00:34:57.850 --> 00:34:59.080
Your gourds cannot
be used for redemption.

966
00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:00.530
Why can't I make the redemption?

967
00:35:00.970 --> 00:35:02.450
Are you trying to bully me?

968
00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:04.410
The Hua family is great bullies.

969
00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:06.410
What's going on?

970
00:35:06.930 --> 00:35:07.890
I'm so mad.

971
00:35:08.530 --> 00:35:09.720
Why don't they allow me
to redeem the doll?

972
00:35:09.810 --> 00:35:10.240
I...

973
00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:13.680
The Hua family's shop

974
00:35:13.810 --> 00:35:14.640
is cheating people

975
00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:15.720
on the first day of business.

976
00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:17.120
I've collected a set of gourds
that can form an idiom,

977
00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:18.600
but they don't allow
me to redeem the doll.

978
00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:21.240
They're just some lousy dolls.

979
00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:23.240
(Shi. Shi)
The character of "shi" we're using

980
00:35:23.330 --> 00:35:24.160
is the character for persimmon.

981
00:35:24.370 --> 00:35:25.640
This is not the right character.

982
00:35:25.850 --> 00:35:26.890
So...

983
00:35:27.010 --> 00:35:27.560
Are you saying that

984
00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:28.970
my gourds are fake?

985
00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:30.970
How is that possible?

986
00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:32.080
My princess

987
00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:33.490
spent a lot of money on these gourds.

988
00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:39.010
She seems to be Princess Jiamin's

989
00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:39.970
servant.

990
00:35:40.890 --> 00:35:42.280
Is she trying to sabotage us?

991
00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:43.280
Don't talk nonsense.

992
00:35:43.370 --> 00:35:44.050
Have you forgotten

993
00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:45.200
what I said to everyone?

994
00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:47.200
We must respect our customers.

995
00:35:48.890 --> 00:35:49.410
All right.

996
00:35:49.490 --> 00:35:50.760
You've worked hard today.

997
00:35:50.890 --> 00:35:52.050
You can clean up the place

998
00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:52.720
and close the shop now.

999
00:35:52.810 --> 00:35:53.640
Thank you, Princess Hua.

1000
00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:56.600
20 plus 17.

1001
00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:58.200
67.

1002
00:35:59.370 --> 00:36:00.850
No.

1003
00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:04.120
The account doesn't tally.

1004
00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:05.080
Your Highness.

1005
00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:06.330
You have been doing
the account for the entire day.

1006
00:36:06.530 --> 00:36:07.890
Why are you going to finish it?

1007
00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:09.760
Don't rush me.

1008
00:36:09.930 --> 00:36:11.680
I don't really understand it
from the start.

1009
00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:13.200
I'm getting mad.

1010
00:36:13.530 --> 00:36:14.600
Let me take a look at it.

1011
00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:15.530
Do you really not know
how to calculate it

1012
00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:16.600
or you don't want to calculate it?

1013
00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:20.200
Your Highness.

1014
00:36:20.890 --> 00:36:22.760
Although I don't really
understand the accounts,

1015
00:36:23.050 --> 00:36:23.890
I think that

1016
00:36:23.970 --> 00:36:25.560
you have a share in the store, too.

1017
00:36:25.850 --> 00:36:26.720
Why do you

1018
00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:27.760
come so late today?

1019
00:36:31.010 --> 00:36:32.600
If I had come earlier,

1020
00:36:32.930 --> 00:36:34.200
all the people on the street

1021
00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:35.200
would have been gone.

1022
00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:37.280
For the sake of your customers,

1023
00:36:37.450 --> 00:36:39.200
I shouldn't simply turn up.

1024
00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:42.410
A store opening gift for you.

1025
00:36:42.850 --> 00:36:43.930
Is it for me?

1026
00:36:49.410 --> 00:36:50.240
Your Highness.

1027
00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:51.810
Did you

1028
00:36:51.890 --> 00:36:53.490
rob anybody today?

1029
00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:56.200
Just accept the gift.

1030
00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:02.530
Thank you, Your Highness.

1031
00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:04.970
Your Highness.

1032
00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:06.640
I made these today.

1033
00:37:06.810 --> 00:37:08.080
Please taste them.

1034
00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:14.530
You made

1035
00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:15.330
the beverage today?

1036
00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:18.860
(Chang)

1037
00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:27.370
How was it?

1038
00:37:27.410 --> 00:37:28.450
It's good, right?

1039
00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:41.410
Your Highness.

1040
00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:42.850
To be honest,

1041
00:37:43.010 --> 00:37:44.120
it's all thanks to Jiamin.

1042
00:37:44.330 --> 00:37:46.010
She brought a lot of people today.

1043
00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:47.410
I never thought that

1044
00:37:47.490 --> 00:37:48.890
so many people would
come to the western suburb.

1045
00:38:03.810 --> 00:38:05.120
Your Highness, what's wrong?

1046
00:38:07.010 --> 00:38:07.760
Your Highness.

1047
00:38:15.490 --> 00:38:17.080
I remember I didn't put
any alcohol in the beverage.

1048
00:38:17.810 --> 00:38:18.890
Why did His Highness

1049
00:38:18.930 --> 00:38:20.050
look drunk?

1050
00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:22.530
Is he getting drunk from drinking milk?

1051
00:38:22.530 --> 00:38:24.760
I'm not drunk.

1052
00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:27.240
I'm drunk? Says who?

1053
00:38:27.450 --> 00:38:28.410
Yes.

1054
00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:29.890
I shall say no more.

1055
00:38:31.850 --> 00:38:32.490
Yuan Wei.

1056
00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:33.720
Ask Crown Prince's

1057
00:38:33.810 --> 00:38:35.120
attendants to come over now.

1058
00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:36.410
Ask them to send Crown Prince home now.

1059
00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:37.080
Yes.

1060
00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:37.930
No.

1061
00:38:39.410 --> 00:38:40.120
I...

1062
00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:42.240
I don't like to go home.

1063
00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:44.160
I like to

1064
00:38:44.330 --> 00:38:45.890
stay in Princess Hua's place.

1065
00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:47.490
No way.

1066
00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:49.200
Last time, you overstayed for a while

1067
00:38:49.370 --> 00:38:51.120
and the officials had
been sending memorials.

1068
00:38:51.410 --> 00:38:52.560
Let Yuan Wei

1069
00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:53.760
send you home later.

1070
00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:54.680
Wait.

1071
00:38:59.490 --> 00:39:00.280
Your Highness.

1072
00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:01.970
Huahua.

1073
00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:04.050
I don't want to go home.

1074
00:39:04.490 --> 00:39:06.410
I want to

1075
00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:08.560
stay with you, Princess Hua.

1076
00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:10.280
Your Highness.

1077
00:39:10.370 --> 00:39:11.120
I have to get prepared

1078
00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:12.560
for business tomorrow.

1079
00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:13.970
Let me send you home.

1080
00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:15.490
Let's go.

1081
00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:15.930
No.

1082
00:39:15.970 --> 00:39:16.530
Let's go.

1083
00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:17.220
I don't want to go home.

1084
00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:19.370
Crown Prince has another side, too.

1085
00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:21.120
Once he wakes up,

1086
00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:23.330
is he going to kill me?

1087
00:39:24.330 --> 00:39:26.530
Miss, please watch out.

1088
00:39:27.450 --> 00:39:28.850
Your Highness.

1089
00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:04.600
Your Highness.

1090
00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:16.080
Your Highness.

1091
00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:19.760
Look. The moon is beautiful.

1092
00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:33.050
Actually, I don't want

1093
00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:34.640
to become the Ceremonial Officer.

1094
00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:37.850
The political situation nowadays

1095
00:40:37.970 --> 00:40:39.200
is ever-changing

1096
00:40:39.810 --> 00:40:41.240
and complicated.

1097
00:40:42.530 --> 00:40:43.760
My father told me

1098
00:40:44.890 --> 00:40:46.530
to have empathy,

1099
00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:49.240
but I just want to protect

1100
00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:50.120
the Hua family.

1101
00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:53.050
The Hua family has contributed a lot

1102
00:40:53.370 --> 00:40:54.600
to the State of Jin.

1103
00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:56.530
We shouldn't

1104
00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:57.530
be treated that way.

1105
00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:07.280
Is he still drunk?

1106
00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:10.720
Your Highness.

1107
00:41:11.530 --> 00:41:12.560
Your Highness.

1108
00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:21.160
(Crown Prince)

1109
00:41:21.490 --> 00:41:23.080
(is pretty cute when he's like this.)

1110
00:41:33.490 --> 00:41:34.050
I...

1111
00:41:34.850 --> 00:41:37.080
Your Highness, you're awake?

1112
00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:41.680

♪Wordless and sleepless under the moon♪

1114
00:41:45.450 --> 00:41:46.410
I shall get going.

1115

Your Highness.

1116
00:41:51.530 --> 00:41:52.080
I...

1117
00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:54.050
Let me send you home.

1118
00:41:55.930 --> 00:41:57.120
That is not necessary.

1119
00:41:58.640 --> 00:41:59.530
I can go back on my own.

1120
00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:06.420
♪But this heart remains the same♪

1121
00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:10.980

1125
00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:28.530
I prepared a present

1126
00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:29.850
for you, Princess Hua.

1127
00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:31.600
Please wait for it

1128
00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:33.240
at home.

1129
00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:35.010
Your Highness.

1130
00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:37.080
I won't tell anyone

1131
00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:39.850
about what happened today.

1132
00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:43.980

00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:52.660

00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:01.120
People at birth are naturally good.

1136
00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:03.720
Their nature is similar, but
their habits become different.

1137
00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:05.680
If not taught...

1138
00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:12.200
What? Who would dare to attack me?

1139
00:43:12.330 --> 00:43:12.970
Who would dare?

1140
00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:14.850
Answer me. What did I say just now?

1141
