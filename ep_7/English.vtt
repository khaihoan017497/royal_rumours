17
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.510
You two should be quiet.

18
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.510
His Highness is still sleeping.

19
00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.640
Your Highness.

20
00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:00.400
Your Highness.

21
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:01.840
Do you want to drink some Ginseng soup?

22
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.070
(How much liquor
did I drink last night?)

23
00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.310
She actually said that

24
00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.400
my eldest brother is better than me.

25
00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.150
I even gave her back the evidence.

26
00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:13.910
I was sincere.

27
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.470
Drink!

28
00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.030
Drink!

30
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.360

No.

32
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:28.360
Qi and Ba.

33
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.960
- Yes.
- Yes.

34
00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.310
Get ready.

35
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.030
I want to go to Hua family.

36
00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.800
Yes.

37
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.660
(Hua Mansion)

38
00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.080
Greetings, Your Highness.

39
00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.870
Miss said

40
00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.280
she needs to avoid gossips,

41
00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.190
so she can't

42
00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.800
accompany Your Highness today

43
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:48.800
for a walk.

44
00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.750
I'm not here to look for her.

45
00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.240
I'm just passing by.

46
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.910
Go to the court.

47
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.520
- Yes.
- Yes.

48
00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.470
It's frightening.

49
00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:04.150
Miss, don't ask me

50
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.400
to pass messages like this anymore.

51
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.030
Protector General Hua has sent someone

52
00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.910
to send Jinpo's General A'Wa

53
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.280
to the capital.

54
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.470
The State of Jin and Jinpo

55
00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.030
are about to discuss about
the peace negotiation.

56
00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:23.910
His Majesty wants to take
this opportunity

57
00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.030
to hold the States Assembly

58
00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.190
and invite the states around

59
00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.190
to send their ambassadors here.

60
00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:34.910
My beloved ministers,

61
00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.190
what are your opinions?

62
00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:38.560
Your Majesty are thinking far.

63
00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.800
This matter brings glory to the state.

64
00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.470
Everyone in the state
should celebrate it.

65
00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.310
I'm planning to choose

66
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.630
a Ceremonial Officer

67
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.750
to talk to Jinpo

68
00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:49.910
regarding the peace negotiation

69
00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.870
and to handle the matter
of the assembly of the states.

70
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.560
I didn't expect to

71
00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.560
see such a scene

72
00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:59.630
in my lifetime.

73
00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.080
This is the demeanour of a great power.

74
00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.190
Grand Preceptor, please take care.

75
00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.560
I think

76
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.310
we should give the chance

77
00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.310
to the young people
for such an auspicious event

78
00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.000
to train them

79
00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.270
so that they can

80
00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.480
carry the State of Jin's future.

81
00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.040
Grand Preceptor, you're right.

82
00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.870
Do you have a good candidate?

83
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:24.830
Father,

84
00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:26.800
as the eldest son,

85
00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.510
I should be the role model.

86
00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:30.830
I'm willing to take the responsibility.

87
00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:32.240
I also think that

88
00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:33.560
no other candidate is

89
00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.870
better than Yuanhao,

90
00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.070
but

91
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:38.800
I think

92
00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.870
the States Assembly is a big event

93
00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.950
so we need to be more careful.

94
00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.070
The States Assembly is a big event.

95
00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.270
I need to think about it.

96
00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.920
At the same time, I need to take

97
00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:53.190
the commoners' opinions into account.

98
00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.160
I'm planning to get
the suitable candidate

99
00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.510
through a competition.

100
00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:00.920
Anyone who is interested

101
00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.870
can join.

102
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.830
No.

103
00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:06.800
No way.

104
00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.070
No way.

105
00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.040
I mustn't let Prince Ying

106
00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.270
to host the peace negotiation.

107
00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:12.800
Miss,

108
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.750
Prince Ying might be slow to react,

109
00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.000
but he's kind.

110
00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:17.560
At least he's not as bad as

111
00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:18.600
Crown Prince.

112
00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.920
Listen to yourself.

113
00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:21.480
Don't just grill the meat on one side.

114
00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.270
Don't judge the book by its cover.

115
00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:24.630
Do you know

116
00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.000
what he said in

117
00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.270
the Hall of Great Awakening?

118
00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:28.830
The source of all problems

119
00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:29.870
is Hua family.

120
00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:31.870
Hua family is raising an army
at the border,

121
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.270
harming the people
and using their money.

122
00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.190
Why not we dismiss the army

123
00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.000
and return peace to the world?

124
00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.270
It will express Jin's sincerity

125
00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:40.750
in the peace negotiation.

126
00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.160
If the army is going to be dismissed,

127
00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:44.190
maybe one day

128
00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:45.830
Jinpo will return.

129
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:47.720
Prince Ying

130
00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.750
is either stupid or bad.

131
00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.510
Looking at the situation,

132
00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.000
he'll surely win the competition.

133
00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:54.480
It's a competition,

134
00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:55.270
but actually

135
00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:56.950
there's no other candidate.

136
00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:59.720
Furthermore, he's a Prince.

137
00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:01.240
He stands a great chance to win.

138
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:05.510
For now,

139
00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:07.560
we need to find someone

140
00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.240
who is of equal status as Prince Ying.

141
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:11.920
Are you talking about

142
00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:13.750
Crown Prince?

143
00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:15.830
But you already asked me to

144
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.190
say those things to His Highness
this morning.

145
00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:25.600
I shouldn't have done that

146
00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:27.160
if I knew this would happen.

147
00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:29.630
That's your initial intention.

148
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:32.510
Let's go.

149
00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:34.480
Where are we going?

150
00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:35.560
We'll look for His Highness.

151
00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.240
We were so arrogant

152
00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.870
like we don't want
to talk to him anymore.

153
00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:40.870
How are we going to convince him?

154
00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.160
I

155
00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.190
will talk heart-to-heart to him.

156
00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:47.270
Miss!

157
00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.000
There can't be only one

158
00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.360
assassin group

159
00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.830
from Jinpo alone.

160
00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.070
Why is no one taking any action?

161
00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:06.190
Your Highness,

162
00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:07.390
Princess Hua is here to seek audience.

163
00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:10.680
So fast?

164
00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:12.870
I'm not meeting her.

165
00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:31.220
(Righteous Radiance)

166
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:35.310
Where is Princess Hua?

167
00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:37.240
She was here just now.

168
00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:39.430
I said I'm not meeting her

169
00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.120
and she didn't even
have the patience to wait for me.

170
00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:42.560
She's lack of patience.

171
00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:43.190
Your Highness.

172
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:44.310
What could she ever achieve?

173
00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:44.830
Your Highness.

174
00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.480
I dare not fool Your Highness around.

175
00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:53.630
Fafa ran out just now.

176
00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:55.830
I was just looking for it.

177
00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:57.510
It's my fault.

178
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.070
I shouldn't have let
Your Highness worry.

179
00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:04.870
Princess Hua, weren't you so sure

180
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.360
of keeping a distance with me?

181
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:08.240
Why did you suddenly look for me,

182
00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.830
a wild beast?

183
00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:12.870
How would Your Highness be a wild beast?

184
00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:15.950
I was dizzy

185
00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:17.800
being blown by the wind

186
00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.190
so I was confused

187
00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:20.390
and I said the wrong thing.

188
00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:22.310
I've come here today

189
00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:23.240
to say sorry

190
00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.120
to Your Highness.

191
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:26.830
Also,

192
00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.750
the distance that I talked about

193
00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:30.750
is the intimate distance.

194
00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:35.630
Princess Hua, you're good at talking.

195
00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:38.080
Princess,

196
00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.630
how are you going to apologise?

197
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.550
Your Highness, why not

198
00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:44.200
we go out today?

199
00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:48.860
(Fragrance bathroom)

200
00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:54.670
Exclusive bathroom.

201
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.590
(Why did I agree to come here)

202
00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:57.110
(with her?)

203
00:08:58.670 --> 00:08:59.360
What's wrong?

204
00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:02.550
Your Highness,
you don't like this place?

205
00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:06.360
I'm not that casual.

206
00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:08.000
It's not casual.

207
00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.150
Being with Your Highness

208
00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:10.670
is not casual.

209
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.030
Princess...

210
00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:15.790
Li.

211
00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:17.150
Coming!

212
00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:20.360
Bring him there.

213
00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:22.320
Your Highness, please.

214
00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:30.960
Your Highness,

215
00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:32.120
I asked someone to

216
00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:33.240
prepare that for you!

217
00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:34.480
Enjoy!

218
00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:37.470
(Enjoy?)

219
00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.360
(This is punishment.)

220
00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:41.630
This is the premium enjoyment

221
00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:43.240
in Qinghan Prefecture.

222
00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:44.960
I'm sure His Highness seldom gets

223
00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:46.150
to enjoy it in the capital.

224
00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:48.150
Besides it's expensive,

225
00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:49.670
it's all good.

226
00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:53.750
I'm working so hard.

227
00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:55.270
I'm sure His Highness can feel

228
00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:56.670
my painstaking effort

229
00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.600
and put his guard down

230
00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.000
to be my friend.

231
00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:12.550
Your Highness,

232
00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:13.960
how did it go?

233
00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:14.960
Was it comfortable?

234
00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:17.030
Hua

235
00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:18.510
Liu

236
00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:19.630
Li.

237
00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:22.670
You're good at taking revenge
for personal grudges.

238
00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:23.870
I'll remember what you did.

239
00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:33.390
(What's going on?)

240
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.670
(Was our service bad?)

241
00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.480
(It's obviously comfortable.)

242
00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:44.670
Taking a bath is comfortable.

243
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:48.080
Why didn't His Highness

244
00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:50.390
appreciate it?

245
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.840
Do we really need to do this?

246
00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:18.200
Miss,

247
00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:19.390
can we think of

248
00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:21.270
a reliable way?

249
00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:23.150
Either we give up

250
00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:24.960
or we stop

251
00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.360
looking for His Highness.

252
00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:27.000
No way.

253
00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:34.080
I can never give up.

254
00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:40.030
(Jinling Garden)
Mr. Xia, you're here.

255
00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:40.670
Please come in.

256
00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:42.000
I heard that His Majesty

257
00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:43.200
will choose the Ceremonial Officer

258
00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:44.360
among the younger ones

259
00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:45.510
to host the States Assembly.

260
00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:47.080
Is your father

261
00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:48.870
supporting Prince Ying?

262
00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:51.750
My father is on the same side with

263
00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:52.630
Minister Tian and the rest.

264
00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:55.480
But, His Highness did

265
00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:56.150
something really weird

266
00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:57.270
lately.

267
00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:58.270
Do you know about that?

268
00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.080
What's it?

269
00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:02.030
His Highness

270
00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.750
is raising a musician.

271
00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.150
He's composed

272
00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:06.630
a song to praise His Majesty.

273
00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:07.840
After His Majesty listened to it,

274
00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:09.320
reward was given

275
00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:10.510
but His Highness was told

276
00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:11.510
not to play it

277
00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:12.720
during the States Assembly.

278
00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:13.480
Otherwise, it's going to

279
00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:15.030
bring shame to the State of Jin.

280
00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:21.600
Your Highness.

281
00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:22.910
Princess Jiamin.

282
00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:25.120
Miss Yao is here too.

283
00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:26.600
What a coincidence.

284
00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:28.000
I...

285
00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:31.200
What are you doing?

286
00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:32.910
Why are you taking all the initiative?

287
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:34.440
I...

288
00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:35.320
I...

289
00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:37.440
I'm afraid that he'd find fault
with Yun Han.

290
00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:39.510
We can stop His Highness

291
00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:40.480
and Yun Han will change the way

292
00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:41.360
he sees us.

293
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.200
You're thinking so much more

294
00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:44.600
than me.

295
00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:49.120
Your Highness,

296
00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:50.790
what are you doing here?

297
00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:52.720
I'm competing for the role

298
00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:54.150
of Ceremonial Officer.

299
00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:55.550
I heard that the best musician

300
00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:57.270
in the capital is
in this music workshop.

301
00:12:57.390 --> 00:12:58.790
That's why I'm here to inspect.

302
00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:00.240
Wenyin and I

303
00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:01.910
are familiar with this music workshop.

304
00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:02.910
Let me take Your Highness around.

305
00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:04.750
That'd be great.

306
00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:06.120
It seems like after that day,

307
00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:07.360
Princess Jiamin's taste

308
00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:08.790
has improved.

309
00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:11.030
Please.

310
00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:12.630
Thank you, Princess Jiamin.

311
00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:19.220
(Ankang Garden)

312
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.120
Not bad, Your Highness.

313
00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:24.630
Your skill has improved

314
00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:25.870
compared to a few days back.

315
00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:27.750
I feel weird too.

316
00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:29.910
I wonder why I'm feeling good

317
00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:31.550
these few days.

318
00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:33.630
Could it be that

319
00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:35.720
Your Highness had a breakthrough

320
00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:36.790
in talking to Princess Hua?

321
00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.960
Don't mention. She's terrible.

322
00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:40.080
Let me tell you.

323
00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:41.670
She build a fragrance bathroom

324
00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:43.240
in her mansion

325
00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:46.670
in the western suburb.

326
00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:49.360
She even invited me there.

327
00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:51.200
That's too much!

328
00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:52.360
Your Highness!

329
00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:56.320
Your Highness

330
00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:57.480
and Princess Hua

331
00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:58.960
are progressing so quickly.

332
00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:00.630
It's beyond my imagination.

333
00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:02.000
Don't simply say that.

334
00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:03.910
Princess Hua and I didn't do anything.

335
00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:05.200
I was trying to upset her

336
00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:06.840
and she looked for a guy

337
00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.320
to keep rubbing

338
00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:10.910
my body

339
00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:12.750
using a rough stone.

340
00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:14.550
I almost lost my life there.

341
00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:18.150
Princess Hua

342
00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:20.910
invited Your Highness to a rubbing bath.

343
00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:22.120
A rubbing bath?

344
00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:23.960
What's a rubbing bath?

345
00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:26.320
Water is scarce

346
00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:27.550
in Qinghan Prefecture.

347
00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:28.720
It's not easy to take a bath there.

348
00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:29.750
Not to mention to soak in water
for a bath.

349
00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.150
It's rare and expensive.

350
00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:32.200
It's precious

351
00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:33.200
in normal families.

352
00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:34.390
They'd take a stone

353
00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:36.240
to rub their bodies.

354
00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:37.720
After rubbing off the dirt,

355
00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:39.030
they soak themselves in the water
for 20 minutes.

356
00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:40.320
Once the hot water is poured,

357
00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:41.440
the feeling...

358
00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:43.960
I feel like taking a rubbing bath.

359
00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:45.480
I see.

360
00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:48.030
He's the best musician in the capital!

361
00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:49.750
Come and take a look!

362
00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:51.440
Listen to me, everyone!

363
00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:51.870
Come and take a look!

364
00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:53.200
The states are coming

365
00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:54.840
and the world will be at peace.

366
00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:57.630
(Support Prince Ying)
As Prince Ying of the State of Jin,

367
00:14:57.910 --> 00:14:58.960
I'm taking the responsibility

368
00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:00.670
to present a petition for the people.

369
00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:02.270
(Support Prince Ying)
So everyone,

370
00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:03.840
(Support Prince Ying)
please support me.

371
00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:06.750
(Support Prince Ying)
I'll give the Sate of Jin a surprise.

372
00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:08.270
When did Jinling Garden

373
00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:09.510
start to do

374
00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:10.440
this kind of business?

375
00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:13.270
Your Highness,

376
00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:14.320
I heard that

377
00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:15.360
it's Princess Jiamin

378
00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:16.440
who spent a lot of money.

379
00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:17.910
Otherwise, the manager

380
00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:19.790
wouldn't have agreed so easily.

381
00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:21.790
Since she wants to be a fool,

382
00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:23.270
just let her be.

383
00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:24.790
Look.

384
00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:26.670
It's crowded and lively.

385
00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:27.630
Miss,

386
00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:28.480
why are we

387
00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:29.670
here?

388
00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:31.080
Why are we helping Prince Ying?

389
00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:33.030
Helping His Highness

390
00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.030
and His Highness will be helping us

391
00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:35.390
to deal with Hua Liuli.

392
00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:37.910
Support Prince Ying!

393
00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:40.000
Support Prince Ying!

394
00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:42.440
Come and support Prince Ying!

395
00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:43.790
Support Prince Ying!

396
00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:45.320
Support Prince Ying!

397
00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:47.080
Support Prince Ying!

398
00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:48.150
Support Prince Ying!

399
00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:49.200
Support Prince Ying!

400
00:15:58.320 --> 00:15:59.240
It hurts.

401
00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:14.500
(Hua Mansion)

402
00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:20.840
(I'm considered)

403
00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:22.200
(giving her enough favour.)

404
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:27.910
I'll go in myself.

405
00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:29.600
Yes.

406
00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:38.540
(Happiness, middle)

407
00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:44.670
How dare someone enter Hua Mansion?

408
00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:47.200
Ever since

409
00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:48.630
His Highness came here,

410
00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:50.020
I've upgraded

411
00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:51.200
the mechanism.

412
00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:54.200
Miss,

413
00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:56.630
it's His Highness again!

414
00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:58.080
Is he here to even the score?

415
00:16:58.240 --> 00:16:59.120
We're done!

416
00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:00.480
We're stopping him again!

417
00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:01.870
Turn off the mechanism quickly.

418
00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:02.390
Okay.

419
00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:03.200
I'll go meet him.

420
00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:11.460
(Ambitious)

421
00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:21.830
Your Highness,

422
00:17:22.070 --> 00:17:24.160
why didn't you get someone to inform us?

423
00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:26.550
Princess Hua,
who are you guarding against?

424
00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:29.400
The mechanism is getting
more and more dangerous.

425
00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:32.240
Didn't the assassins come here?

426
00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:34.200
I'm just too scared.

427
00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:35.590
So,

428
00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:37.270
I've set another mechanism.

429
00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:38.640
That's right.

430
00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:41.920
A few remnants are still on the run.

431
00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:44.110
You should be careful.

432
00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:47.880
If I knew Your Highness is coming,

433
00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:50.110
how would I turn on

434
00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:51.720
the mechanism?

435
00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:54.030
Your Highness,

436
00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:57.000
do you want to go in and take a rest?

437
00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:58.920
Let me

438
00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:00.070
sew the sleeve for you.

439
00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:13.510
Please.

440
00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:14.880
Please.

441
00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:19.110
Princess Hua, your sewing skill...

442
00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:20.400
Not bad, right?

443
00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:21.720
(No way.)

444
00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:23.310
It comes naturally.

445
00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:24.400
You're talented.

446
00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:25.590
Thank you.

447
00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:29.920
Your Highness,

448
00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:31.790
why not we use white string?

449
00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:33.000
Is that okay?

450
00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:34.640
I think

451
00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:36.750
I don't want to trouble you,
Princess Hua.

452
00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:38.830
No worries.

453
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:39.590
It's not necessary.

454
00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:40.350
No worries. Don't...

455
00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:41.110
It's not necessary.

456
00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:42.030
No worries.

457
00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:43.350
Give it to me. No worries.

458
00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:51.070
It seems like

459
00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:53.200
I need to sew it.

460
00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:54.880
It's torn.

461
00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:16.110
The rubbing bath that day

462
00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:19.350
is a practice in Qinghan Prefecture?

463
00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:20.590
Yes.

464
00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.350
I brought the stone here

465
00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:24.750
from Qinghan Prefecture.

466
00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:27.110
Bathing using that stone

467
00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:28.830
refreshes us.

468
00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:30.030
However,

469
00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:33.110
it doesn't seem suitable.

470
00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:35.110
Why is it not suitable?

471
00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:36.750
In Qinghan Prefecture,

472
00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:37.920
water is so much lesser than human.

473
00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:39.480
We only have a big lake.

474
00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:40.880
Most importantly,

475
00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:41.800
people from Jinpo

476
00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:42.880
are fighting for it with us.

477
00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:45.720
So, if we won,

478
00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.920
we'd be able to get some borders.

479
00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:49.200
Then we'll be able to

480
00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:50.750
take more showers.

481
00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:52.830
If we lose,

482
00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:54.200
we'll have to use water

483
00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:55.680
wisely in that whole year.

484
00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:57.880
But after I came to the capital,

485
00:19:58.030 --> 00:19:58.680
I realised that

486
00:19:58.880 --> 00:19:59.680
using water

487
00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:01.680
isn't difficult here.

488
00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:04.350
So I thought

489
00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:06.440
I could please Your Highness.

490
00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:08.310
However...

491
00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:10.350
Actually,

492
00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:12.270
I think taking a bath every now and then

493
00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:14.480
is kind of fresh.

494
00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:16.270
Princess, you're overly concerned.

495
00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:17.880
Do you really think so?

496
00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:18.750
Of course.

497
00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:23.920
Don't move.

498
00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:28.070
(Hua Liuli)

499
00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:29.240
(looks cute)

500
00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:30.680
(sometimes.)

501
00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:33.440
Stay calm.

502
00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:34.480
Almost there.

503
00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:35.830
Look.

504
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:36.830
What's this?

505
00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:39.440
Well...

506
00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:41.400
This big white bear

507
00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:43.200
looks lively.

508
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.510
This is not a big white bear.

509
00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:47.270
Could it be a small white rat?

510
00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:48.960
No.

511
00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:50.750
Obviously this is Fafa.

512
00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:51.920
Is it not obvious?

513
00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:52.960
Fafa?

514
00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:55.880
So you've giving
this scented sachet to me?

515
00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:57.920
Didn't I make it obvious

516
00:20:58.160 --> 00:20:59.880
for the last few days?

517
00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:01.480
Obvious?

518
00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:04.750
How is it obvious?

519
00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:05.960
Look.

520
00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:07.640
My fingers are hurt.

521
00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:09.240
Look. Here.

522
00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:10.270
Here, here,

523
00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:11.720
here and here.

524
00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:13.480
It hurts.

525
00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:13.810
Look.

526
00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:15.590
Princess Hua, you must rest well.

527
00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:20.550
Here. I've roughly sewn it.

528
00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:22.680
Your Highness, are you satisfied?

529
00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:24.160
I'm satisfied.

530
00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:25.830
I'm satisfied.

531
00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:30.640
Your Highness,

532
00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:32.470
can we

533
00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:33.830
talk nicely now?

534
00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:42.830
Princess Hua, you wanted

535
00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:44.750
to cut ties with me so badly before.

536
00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:47.400
Now, you're trying to be nice to me.

537
00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:48.310
With my

538
00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:49.640
doubtful personality,

539
00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:51.680
it's hard for me

540
00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:53.960
not to overthink.

541
00:21:57.310 --> 00:21:58.350
However, the scented sachet

542
00:21:58.510 --> 00:21:59.750
is a token from you.

543
00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:00.880
I'll keep it.

544
00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:09.960
(Hua Mansion)

545
00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:11.640
Why isn't His Highness coming out yet?

546
00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:16.400
Your Highness.

547
00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:18.280
Your...

548
00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:20.310
This...

549
00:22:23.030 --> 00:22:24.350
Where did you pick up
the scented sachet?

550
00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:25.790
It's so ugly.

551
00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:27.400
I didn't pick it up.

552
00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:28.640
It's a gift.

553
00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:35.590
Did Princess Hua sew it for you?

554
00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.440
She sewed it.

555
00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:41.070
Your favourite

556
00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:42.480
thing in Ankang Garden.

557
00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:46.030
This is too cute.

558
00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:47.480
Look at the scented sachet.

559
00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:48.920
It matches perfectly

560
00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:50.480
with Your Highness.

561
00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:52.480
It's a match in heaven.

562
00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:54.880
A perfect match.

563
00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:56.480
Didn't you say it's ugly?

564
00:22:58.550 --> 00:22:59.960
I was talking about myself.

565
00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:02.160
Your Highness,

566
00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:03.240
how was your conversation

567
00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:04.160
with Princess Hua?

568
00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:05.960
She kept me

569
00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:07.000
chasing after her before this.

570
00:23:07.550 --> 00:23:08.830
Now, it's her turn.

571
00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:10.480
The matter involves Hua family.

572
00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:12.030
She has to take action.

573
00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:13.790
We just need to wait.

574
00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:15.400
(Didn't we come here for an inspection?)

575
00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:16.790
(His Highness...)

576
00:23:17.550 --> 00:23:18.830
Your Highness, you're wise.

577
00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:22.550
Besides that,

578
00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:24.550
I have other plans

579
00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:25.960
for the two assassins.

580
00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:36.830
I told you that it's not simple.

581
00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:37.830
His Highness is

582
00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:38.920
the Crown Prince.

583
00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:40.160
Does His Highness need to work hard?

584
00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:41.160
No need.

585
00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:42.640
If His Highness doesn't
need to work hard,

586
00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:44.510
why does His Highness need to fight
against Prince Ying?

587
00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.030
But who else

588
00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:47.590
if not His Highness?

589
00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:50.440
Why not we talk to

590
00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:51.550
Prince Ying

591
00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:53.240
and ask His Highness to change his mind?

592
00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:54.750
Think about it.

593
00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:56.480
Who is behind Prince Ying?

594
00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:58.790
His mother, Consort Xian.

595
00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:01.200
His teacher, Grand Preceptor Du.

596
00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:03.030
Don't you remember what

597
00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:04.160
Grand Preceptor Du's stand is?

598
00:24:05.550 --> 00:24:06.550
We're not sure.

599
00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:08.590
Why not we support Prince Ying?

600
00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:09.830
(Support Prince Ying)
His Majesty said it's a competition.

601
00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:11.960
After all, there's no one
else to support.

602
00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:13.720
Obviously, His Majesty

603
00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:15.400
wants His Highness to be chosen.

604
00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:16.480
See?

605
00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:17.920
All these are about
supporting Prince Ying.

606
00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:20.640
Who are you supporting?

607
00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:21.750
(I must grab)

608
00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:22.440
(His Highness)

609
00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:23.590
(as my life-saving straw.)

610
00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:28.590
It seems like

611
00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:31.350
this weak and sick

612
00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:32.750
beautiful princess

613
00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:34.680
has to personally

614
00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:37.160
beg His Highness.

615
00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:39.590
Let's go.

616
00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:48.920
(Ankang Garden)

617
00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:49.720
Greetings, Your Highness.

618
00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:51.000
Is His Highness around?

619
00:24:51.270 --> 00:24:52.440
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

620
00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:54.110
His Highness is not here today.

621
00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:55.720
Did he go to the Eastern Palace?

622
00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:56.830
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

623
00:24:57.070 --> 00:24:57.830
I really don't know

624
00:24:58.030 --> 00:24:59.240
where His Highness has gone to.

625
00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:01.310
Thank you.

626
00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:09.550
Is His Highness

627
00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:11.160
avoiding us?

628
00:25:12.550 --> 00:25:13.720
His Highness is pure,

629
00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:15.070
diligent

630
00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:17.510
and smart.

631
00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:20.070
His Highness only goes to two places,

632
00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:22.070
Ankang Garden and Eastern Palace.

633
00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:24.790
If there's a case,

634
00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:26.270
Supreme Court would be another.

635
00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:27.510
Tell me.

636
00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:28.160
Where should we go

637
00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:29.000
to find him?

638
00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:32.480
Why do I feel like

639
00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:34.160
you're talking about someone else?

640
00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:36.270
Are we not trying to please him?

641
00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:42.030
We've finally caught the two assassins,

642
00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:45.240
but the court asked us to let them go.

643
00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:48.480
Enough, Your Highness.

644
00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:50.510
They're just some thieves.

645
00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:51.790
We can let them go.

646
00:25:59.270 --> 00:26:00.680
Your Highness, are you saying that

647
00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:01.830
the peace negotiation

648
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.550
has to be compromised?

649
00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:11.830
Jinpo's General A'Wa

650
00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:13.790
will be sent to the capital
by the Hua family.

651
00:26:13.790 --> 00:26:14.750
What are they talking about?

652
00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:17.350
Be quiet.

653
00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:19.070
However, there are

654
00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:20.270
a few ignorant officers

655
00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:21.550
said that since

656
00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:23.160
Jinpo is yielding,

657
00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:24.880
we need to show them that
we're magnanimous too.

658
00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:26.750
That's the officers' style

659
00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:27.960
in the State of Jin.

660
00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:29.270
They're stupid!

661
00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:33.240
They said the peace negotiation
between two states is going on.

662
00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:34.720
They can't kill us anymore!

663
00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:40.270
So, the two thieves...

664
00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:41.920
Release them.

665
00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:43.510
Release them?

666
00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:44.960
Release them!

667
00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:46.070
Yes.

668
00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:47.400
We're...

669
00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:49.480
Free now!

670
00:26:57.070 --> 00:26:57.920
You're free.

671
00:26:58.200 --> 00:26:58.830
Go out.

672
00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:08.270
If I'm not mistaken,

673
00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:10.270
once the two thieves are released,

674
00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:11.680
the new assassin

675
00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:13.550
will very likely to
pretend to be like them.

676
00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:16.030
Even if the mastermind is
not doing anything,

677
00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:18.270
we can find the clue and hint

678
00:27:18.790 --> 00:27:20.640
to catch all the assassins.

679
00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:22.750
Your Highness, your move

680
00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:24.310
is amazing.

681
00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:27.440
I can even manipulate

682
00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:28.830
Hua Liuli.

683
00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:31.550
This is nothing.

684
00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:46.020
(Supreme Court)

685
00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:51.270
Our old friends are here.

686
00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:55.960
Let's go!

687
00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:06.440
Your Highness.

688
00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:10.480
Your Highness.

689
00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:15.000
Help me take this.

690
00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:16.720
Your Highness, I have something on.

691
00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:17.590
I'm leaving now!

692
00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:20.110
Bai!

693
00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:41.030
Yuan Wei.

694
00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:41.880
Bai.

695
00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.200
Pei Jihuai!

696
00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:47.070
If I didn't investigate
about how Miss

697
00:28:47.270 --> 00:28:48.830
was poisoned in
the plum blossom banquet,

698
00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:49.960
I wouldn't have known that

699
00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:51.350
- you're His Highness' man.
- I...

700
00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:51.880
I...

701
00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:53.310
You're also the Junior Secretary
of Supreme Court.

702
00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:54.590
I'm sorry.

703
00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.550
It's my fault.

704
00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:57.200
Yuan Wei,

705
00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:58.440
listen to my explanation.

706
00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:00.590
Yuan Wei,

707
00:29:02.030 --> 00:29:03.510
can you listen to my explanation?

708
00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:08.680
Your Highness,

709
00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:10.270
(Supreme Court)
are you going to Ankang Garden

710
00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:11.400
or Eastern Palace?

711
00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:14.790
It depends on my mood.

712
00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:17.240
Let me send you there.

713
00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:20.310
Or

714
00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:22.070
let me sit in your carriage.

715
00:29:22.270 --> 00:29:23.350
(Not again?)

716
00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:25.480
(Can you do something new?)

717
00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.830
I've been walking for the whole day.

718
00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.270
It's tiring.

719
00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:33.270
My legs are sore.

720
00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:35.110
Why not we do this?

721
00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:36.920
Princess Hua and I

722
00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:38.480
will go to Ankang Garden.

723
00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.440
Okay, let's go.

724
00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:49.550
Yuan Wei.

725
00:29:50.270 --> 00:29:51.200
Well,

726
00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:52.960
this matter actually goes like this.

727
00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:54.510
So,

728
00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:56.440
you came to work in Hua Mansion

729
00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:58.070
because it's His Highness' order.

730
00:29:58.480 --> 00:29:59.030
Were you trying to

731
00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:00.110
harm Hua family?

732
00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:02.440
That's in the past.

733
00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:03.480
It doesn't matter anymore.

734
00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:05.920
Don't forget though.

735
00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:07.750
Princess Hua

736
00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:09.070
is asking for a favour

737
00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:10.160
from His Highness now.

738
00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:10.920
You...

739
00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:13.720
You're just a liar.

740
00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:15.480
I was

741
00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:17.790
feeling so sad when you were leaving.

742
00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:20.510
What did you say?

743
00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:21.750
You were what?

744
00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:23.440
I said

745
00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:24.720
you're just a liar.

746
00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:25.880
A liar!

747
00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.270
Since you're saying that,

748
00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:32.310
it was you

749
00:30:32.550 --> 00:30:33.480
who asked me

750
00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:34.720
to work for you.

751
00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:35.750
I didn't think much.

752
00:30:36.510 --> 00:30:37.920
Say that again!

753
00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:39.160
Your miss

754
00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:40.550
is being harassed by His Highness!

755
00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:44.750
Pei Jihuai!

756
00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:49.680
(She's trying to be nice.)

757
00:30:50.270 --> 00:30:51.720
(I'm afraid this is not good.)

758
00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:53.590
Your Highness.

759
00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:00.310
I think

760
00:31:00.590 --> 00:31:01.590
Your Highness has taken away

761
00:31:01.790 --> 00:31:02.790
my scented sachet.

762
00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:03.960
It means

763
00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:05.070
you and I

764
00:31:05.270 --> 00:31:06.480
have reconciled.

765
00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:07.790
Now,

766
00:31:08.030 --> 00:31:09.350
we can sit down

767
00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:10.960
and discuss about something.

768
00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:12.960
(I knew this is coming.)

769
00:31:13.510 --> 00:31:14.110
Fine.

770
00:31:14.510 --> 00:31:16.350
Princess Hua, you're right.

771
00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:18.160
Why not you tell me straight?

772
00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:19.240
What's your thought?

773
00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:22.680
I'd like Your Highness

774
00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:24.640
to compete for
the Ceremonial Officer position.

775
00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:27.310
The Ceremonial Officer?

776
00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:30.720
Princess Hua, why are you saying that?

777
00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:32.480
For the sake of Hua family.

778
00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:35.550
Your Highness knows that

779
00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:37.200
only Prince Ying alone

780
00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:39.240
is competing for
the Ceremonial Officer position.

781
00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:40.920
But His Highness

782
00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:42.070
isn't friendly

783
00:31:42.270 --> 00:31:43.510
towards Hua family.

784
00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:45.000
I think

785
00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:47.440
Hua family shouldn't be
treated this way.

786
00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:51.070
What does it

787
00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:52.960
have to do with me?

788
00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:54.400
I think

789
00:31:54.590 --> 00:31:56.160
Your Highness will become
the future Emperor.

790
00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:57.480
You'll consider the peace

791
00:31:57.640 --> 00:31:59.160
between the two states.

792
00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:00.790
Even if Your Highness' idea

793
00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.640
is different

794
00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:03.680
from His Highness,

795
00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:06.000
but only when two swords meet,

796
00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:07.270
we'll know which one is sharper.

797
00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:09.030
I'm just trying to fight for

798
00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:10.350
Hua family's reputation.

799
00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:11.830
The future Emperor?

800
00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:14.880
Don't you know

801
00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:16.720
how others

802
00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:18.640
are criticising me?

803
00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:19.750
I know,

804
00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.270
but I think

805
00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:23.960
it's because Your Highness
doesn't know how to express

806
00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:26.000
or you don't think there's a need
to express at all.

807
00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:27.750
That's why the misunderstanding was created.

808
00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:31.270
Your Highness gave Hua Mansion to me

809
00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:32.590
and you guarded it

810
00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:34.240
to protect me.

811
00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:35.590
Your Highness, you've

812
00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:37.510
saved me many times.

813
00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:39.200
So I think...

814
00:32:40.030 --> 00:32:41.400
Fruit jam was made into blood.

815
00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:43.070
Food supply was cut
and you used it to earn money.

816
00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:44.160
A shabby mansion was made luxury.

817
00:32:44.350 --> 00:32:45.880
The assassins failed all the time.

818
00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:47.590
You've done so many things

819
00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:48.400
one after another.

820
00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:50.720
Princess Hua, you're so smart.

821
00:32:52.510 --> 00:32:53.480
Why do you need my favour?

822
00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:55.270
Your Highness, are you blaming me?

823
00:32:55.790 --> 00:32:56.960
I'm complimenting you.

824
00:32:57.550 --> 00:32:58.070
Hold on.

825
00:32:59.110 --> 00:33:00.510
Actually, I've been meaning to say

826
00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:03.200
you don't have to

827
00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:04.920
pretend in front of me.

828
00:33:05.550 --> 00:33:06.510
You can actually...

829
00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:10.350
So Your Highness has never

830
00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:12.160
trusted me

831
00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:13.440
and has been doubting Hua family's

832
00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:14.590
loyalty to the imperial court.

833
00:33:15.070 --> 00:33:15.880
I believe

834
00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:16.550
Your Highness and I

835
00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:17.590
have nothing to talk about.

836
00:33:17.790 --> 00:33:18.310
I'm leaving.

837
00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:20.550
Princess!

838
00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:25.160
Look at what I've done.

839
00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:27.960
(Elegance)

840
00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:29.200
Greetings, Your Highness.

841
00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:39.160
Your Highness, the tea is here.

842
00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:41.750
Princess,

843
00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:43.110
weren't you upset?

844
00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:44.680
Your Highness, you know

845
00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:46.790
that I don't do things for nothing.

846
00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:49.720
I've done so many thing
for Your Highness lately.

847
00:33:50.110 --> 00:33:51.680
I need to drink the tea before I leave.

848
00:33:52.350 --> 00:33:52.960
Come

849
00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:54.720
and serve Princess tea.

850
00:33:54.790 --> 00:33:55.160
Yes.

851
00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:01.350
Your Highness.

852
00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:03.720
How could you treat the servant
this way?

853
00:34:04.110 --> 00:34:05.440
Look at her hands.

854
00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:07.270
Her fingers are so rough.

855
00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:08.330
Even her Hoku

856
00:34:08.330 --> 00:34:09.360
is rough.

857
00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:10.550
It's similar

858
00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:11.630
to the guy I know

859
00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:12.630
who is always holding a sword.

860
00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:14.000
Guard!

861
00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:35.230
Miss,

862
00:34:35.630 --> 00:34:37.000
His Highness is a nice guy.

863
00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:38.630
Why are you doing this?

864
00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:40.880
Your Highness, are you okay?

865
00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:43.630
I've been serving in Ankang Garden
for a few years

866
00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:44.960
for today.

867
00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:46.280
You've ruined my plan

868
00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:47.630
and you're pretending to be innocent.

869
00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:49.670
I really didn't mean it.

870
00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:50.550
You...

871
00:34:56.510 --> 00:34:58.510
You've been waiting by my side
for a few years.

872
00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:01.030
Not bad.

873
00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:03.000
You're taking the opportunity

874
00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.400
to frame the two Jinpo assassins

875
00:35:05.070 --> 00:35:06.030
as soon as I've released them.

876
00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:07.150
Do you know

877
00:35:08.110 --> 00:35:09.760
this was my plan?

878
00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.230
Take her to the Supreme Court.

879
00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:13.960
Interrogate her
and find out who her mastermind is.

880
00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:14.800
- Yes.
- Yes.

881
00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:15.840
Also,

882
00:35:16.110 --> 00:35:17.630
investigate everyone in the chamber

883
00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:18.630
and Eastern Palace again.

884
00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:19.510
Take her away.

885
00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:20.400
- Yes.
- Yes.

886
00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:30.630
Princess, are you frightened?

887
00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:34.150
This is too frightening.

888
00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:43.440
Greetings, Your Highness.

889
00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:45.670
(This servant)

890
00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.320
(walks without making any sound.)

891
00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:57.840
I'm so sorry.

892
00:35:58.030 --> 00:35:59.480
I've hit you accidentally.

893
00:35:59.710 --> 00:36:00.590
Be careful, Your Highness.

894
00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:02.710
(She knows martial arts.)

895
00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:03.590
(This is bad.)

896
00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:04.880
I should

897
00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:08.400
thank you for just now, Princess Hua.

898
00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:11.110
Ceremonial Officer, right?

899
00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:12.710
Fine.

900
00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:13.920
I promise you.

901
00:36:14.670 --> 00:36:16.360
Come to the Hall of Great Awakening tomorrow

902
00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:18.710
and wait for my good news.

903
00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:24.740
(Hua Mansion)

904
00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:27.700
(Ambitious)

905
00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:29.880
Let me eat this too.

906
00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:31.630
I was really frightened just now.

907
00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:32.400
I need to eat more

908
00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:33.110
to replenish myself.

909
00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:34.590
Are you listening to yourself?

910
00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:36.510
You almost exposed
your martial arts today.

911
00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:37.550
Have you forgotten

912
00:36:37.550 --> 00:36:39.000
what you promised General Hua?

913
00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:40.030
What do you know?

914
00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:41.000
I did that

915
00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:42.190
to please His Highness

916
00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:44.190
so that His Highness
would compete with Prince Ying.

917
00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:45.960
Was it easy for me to do all those?

918
00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:48.360
Miss,

919
00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:50.150
look at my eyes.

920
00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:56.320
What's wrong with your eyes?

921
00:36:58.400 --> 00:36:59.880
You didn't wash your face today.

922
00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:01.030
Miss!

923
00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:01.590
All right.

924
00:37:01.590 --> 00:37:02.320
I'll stop.

925
00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:02.880
Let me see.

926
00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:07.630
Your big eyes are red and swollen.

927
00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:11.710
Did you cry again

928
00:37:12.670 --> 00:37:14.480
for Pei Jihuai today?

929
00:37:15.590 --> 00:37:16.590
How did you know?

930
00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:18.030
He's terrible.

931
00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:19.190
He cheated me for my feeling.

932
00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:20.760
He ran away when he saw me.

933
00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:22.440
That's too much.

934
00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:23.590
When I see him next time,

935
00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:24.880
I'll teach him a lesson for you.

936
00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:27.480
Miss, you're taking it too far off.

937
00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:29.230
Look at my eyes.

938
00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:30.440
All right.

939
00:37:31.110 --> 00:37:31.760
Miss,

940
00:37:32.590 --> 00:37:34.590
tell me honestly and sincerely.

941
00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:37.840
Are you attracted by his look

942
00:37:38.110 --> 00:37:39.360
and you're in love with His Highness?

943
00:37:40.070 --> 00:37:40.960
I'm just pitying him

944
00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:41.960
because he's just like me.

945
00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:43.590
Someone wants to kill him.

946
00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:44.760
Someone wants to kill me.

947
00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.280
Who else would help him
if I'm not helping him?

948
00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:47.710
You're too nosy.

949
00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.070
Get the snacks here.

950
00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:52.230
Hurry.

951
00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:54.880
You're talkative.

952
00:37:55.710 --> 00:37:56.920
(She's so smart.)

953
00:37:57.110 --> 00:37:58.150
(Luckily I responded quickly.)

954
00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:01.340
(Ankang Garden)

955
00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:04.480
(Grace)

956
00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:04.920
Let's go!

957
00:38:06.670 --> 00:38:07.190
Your Highness,

958
00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:08.630
I'll interrogate

959
00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:09.760
these few people.

960
00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:11.840
But for safety purpose,

961
00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:13.400
should we change

962
00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:14.480
all the people

963
00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:15.670
in Ankang Garden?

964
00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:17.400
Including Eastern Palace.

965
00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:18.630
Yes.

966
00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:22.280
Young Master,

967
00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:23.920
all the people that

968
00:38:24.150 --> 00:38:24.880
we've sent to His Highness' side

969
00:38:25.110 --> 00:38:26.110
has been changed.

970
00:38:26.510 --> 00:38:27.400
I wonder how

971
00:38:27.630 --> 00:38:28.480
we'll deal with this.

972
00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:35.030
We shouldn't take any action now.

973
00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:36.710
We need to wait for another opportunity.

974
00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:38.280
Or

975
00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:40.190
you wish to see

976
00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:41.920
me being involved?

977
00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:43.510
No.

978
00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:44.880
Master

979
00:38:45.110 --> 00:38:46.480
doesn't want us to

980
00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:47.710
to dwell here for fun

981
00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:50.230
and forget about our assignment.

982
00:38:54.590 --> 00:38:55.630
(Yunzhong Hall)
Your Highness, you're here.

983
00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:29.150
Miss.

984
00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:30.070
Didn't you want to

985
00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:31.440
practise walking like a feeble beauty?

986
00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:33.880
Why are you writing now?

987
00:39:34.510 --> 00:39:36.070
I'm not writing.

988
00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:38.000
Well, Prince Ying

989
00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:39.800
and His Highness are competing.

990
00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:41.480
I want to help him

991
00:39:41.710 --> 00:39:42.880
so I've concluded something.

992
00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:44.110
Look.

993
00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:49.920
Prince Ying's strength.

994
00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:52.630
Diligent, easygoing

995
00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.190
and polite.

996
00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:55.000
Shortcomings.

997
00:39:55.230 --> 00:39:56.710
Arrogant, stupid

998
00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:57.710
and ordinary.

999
00:39:57.710 --> 00:39:59.060
(Arrogant, stupid)

1000
00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:00.400
Crown Prince's strength.

1001
00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:01.510
None.

1002
00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:04.800
There's indeed none.

1003
00:40:06.190 --> 00:40:07.320
Crown Prince's shortcomings.

1004
00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:09.920
Notorious, cruel, unpredictable,

1005
00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:11.510
eccentric, bully,

1006
00:40:11.550 --> 00:40:12.760
stir up trouble for no reason,
neglect one's work,

1007
00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:14.000
indulgent in seeking pleasure,
insensitive to others' feelings,

1008
00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:14.840
and cruel.

1009
00:40:16.590 --> 00:40:17.070
Well...

1010
00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:18.440
His Highness's reputation

1011
00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:19.400
is so bad.

1012
00:40:20.030 --> 00:40:22.880
From infamy to fame

1013
00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.760
is very difficult.

1014
00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:29.110
Your Highness.

1015
00:40:35.550 --> 00:40:36.880
I want to withdraw

1016
00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:37.960
my prejudice towards Hua family.

1017
00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:43.510
Is it because Princess Hua managed

1018
00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:45.150
to find the assassin?

1019
00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:47.480
Not just that.

1020
00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:51.190
Even though Princess Hua

1021
00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:52.110
is suspicious,

1022
00:40:52.190 --> 00:40:53.440
schemeful

1023
00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:54.800
and pretentious,

1024
00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:55.920
there's one thing

1025
00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:57.400
that she can't pretend.

1026
00:40:58.400 --> 00:40:59.550
Although we've killed 10,000 enemies

1027
00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:02.000
in the war,

1028
00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:04.280
Jin Army was only left with
few thousands.

1029
00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:06.550
None of them was living for themselves.

1030
00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:08.710
None of them died for themselves.

1031
00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:10.760
They fought for their parents.

1032
00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:12.320
They fought for their children.

1033
00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:13.320
They fought for

1034
00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:15.110
the peace in the State of Jin.

1035
00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:17.240
When Hua family was being suspected,

1036
00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:18.110
she felt the pain

1037
00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:19.440
and the patriotism hidden

1038
00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:20.710
in her bones

1039
00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:23.000
can't be pretended.

1040
00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:24.630
Your Highness...

1041
00:41:26.070 --> 00:41:27.710
I want to try to trust her.

1042
00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:30.190
Just like how I trust you.

1043
00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:43.110
I've spoken to you all a few days back

1044
00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:45.960
regarding choosing

1045
00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:48.320
a Ceremonial Officer

1046
00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:49.630
to host the States Assembly.

1047
00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:51.960
Besides Yuanhao,

1048
00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:55.840
is there anyone else

1049
00:41:56.190 --> 00:41:57.110
who is willing to try?

1050
00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:00.480
If there's none,

1051
00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:02.360
this matter

1052
00:42:02.670 --> 00:42:03.070
Father.

1053
00:42:03.070 --> 00:42:03.480
will...

1054
00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:07.880
I have an idea.

1055
00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:08.760
What?

1056
00:42:09.590 --> 00:42:10.670
Are you joining the competition?

1057
00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:14.590
I'm not suitable,

1058
00:42:15.150 --> 00:42:15.730
but I

1059
00:42:15.730 --> 00:42:17.110
have a suitable candidate.

1060
00:42:17.670 --> 00:42:18.230
Who is it?

1061
00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:20.110
Protector General Hua's daughter,

1062
00:42:20.590 --> 00:42:22.110
Princess Hua Liuli.

1063
00:42:23.110 --> 00:42:23.710
What?

1064
00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:25.590
Hua Liuli?

1065
00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:28.510
How can I be competing with Princess Hua

1066
00:42:28.710 --> 00:42:29.630
for the position?

1067
00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:30.800
No way.

1068
00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:32.150
No way.

1069
00:42:33.110 --> 00:42:34.230
Crown Prince's suggestion

1070
00:42:34.670 --> 00:42:35.920
is impactful.

1071
00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:37.800
Why do you say so?

1072
00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:40.360
All the states that are coming

1073
00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:42.710
have been defeated by
the Hua family before,

1074
00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:44.000
especially Jinpo.

1075
00:42:44.230 --> 00:42:45.190
All the shame of being defeated

1076
00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:47.000
was given by the Hua family.

1077
00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:48.960
His Highness

1078
00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:50.150
is suggesting Hua Liuli

1079
00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:52.320
so that he'll gather the flaws
of the Hua family.

1080
00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:53.480
Ridiculous.

1081
00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:56.280
How can you do that?

1082
00:42:57.030 --> 00:42:58.840
That's the States Assembly.

1083
00:42:59.630 --> 00:43:01.400
How can we let Miss Hua

1084
00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:03.800
become the host?

1085
00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:09.000
Your Majesty,

1086
00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:12.590
you mustn't agree to that.

1087
00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:16.400
Well,

1088
00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:21.510
summon Hua Liuli to the court tomorrow.

1089
00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:22.550
Father,

1090
00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.630
Princess Hua happens to be at outside.

1091
00:43:26.190 --> 00:43:27.440
What's going on?

1092
00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:32.630
San Cai, bring Hua Liuli in.

1093
00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:33.670
Yes.

1094
00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:36.440
Ways to save His Highness' reputation.

1095
00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:38.110
What do you think?

1096
00:43:39.070 --> 00:43:40.760
This is funny.

1097
00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:43.760
Why is my eye

1098
00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:45.320
twitching so badly today?

1099
00:43:45.670 --> 00:43:46.800
Left eye or right eye?

1100
00:43:47.070 --> 00:43:47.920
Left eye.

1101
00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:49.630
Left eye twitching is good.

1102
00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:51.440
You said the same thing the other day.

1103
00:43:51.590 --> 00:43:52.360
I was found out by mother

1104
00:43:52.590 --> 00:43:53.230
for reading storybook

1105
00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:54.510
and I had to copy the books for a month.

1106
00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:56.230
That's because the book you read

1107
00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:57.110
was

1108
00:43:57.360 --> 00:43:58.840
"Domineering General's Love

1109
00:43:59.070 --> 00:44:00.280
For Beauty"

1110
00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:01.510
Princess Hua.

1111
00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:03.230
(Chenming Palace)
Princess Hua.

1112
00:44:04.590 --> 00:44:05.400
Eunuch Zhao.

1113
00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:06.880
You're really here.

1114
00:44:07.110 --> 00:44:08.920
His Majesty is summoning you
to the palace.

1115
00:44:09.150 --> 00:44:10.030
Summoning me?

1116
00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:11.590
Please come with me.

1117
00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:18.540
(Pretentious Hour)

1118
00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:22.460
(Support Prince Ying)

1119
00:44:28.670 --> 00:44:29.320
Here you go.

1120
00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:35.230
Who am I?

1121
00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:36.070
What am I doing?

1122
00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:37.670
Why should I support Prince Ying?

1123
00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:39.230
Who are you supporting
if it's not His Highness?

1124
00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:40.110
Are you not supporting me?

1125
00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:41.960
Support me and you need
to support His Highness.

1126
00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:43.960
Supporting His Highness
means you're supporting me.

1127
00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:45.550
Of course I support you.

1128
00:44:46.030 --> 00:44:46.880
