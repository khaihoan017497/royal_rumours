17
00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.880
Your Highness.

18
00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:58.720
You're up.

19
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:02.570
Princess Hua.

20
00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:04.600
You must be hungry.

21
00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:05.410
I'm good.

22
00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.010
Come on.

23
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.290
The dinner is ready.

24
00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:09.480
Have a seat.

25
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.250
Don't worry, Your Highness.

26
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.850
These are

27
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.760
all the capital dishes,

28
00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.410
not the ones we have back home.

29
00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.320
They are sure to be to your liking.

30
00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.130
(It's all)

31
00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.640
(my favourite dishes.)

32
00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:49.690
I used to think

33
00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.250
the food in the capital

34
00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.370
was new and exciting,

35
00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:54.880
but then

36
00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.010
I would miss

37
00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.290
the taste of Qinghan Prefecture.

38
00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.040
However, somehow

39
00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.130
I find the taste

40
00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.600
to be to my liking.

41
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.410
(Liuli)

42
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.130
(is so thoughtful.)

43
00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.760
Your Highness.

44
00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.290
Eat up.

45
00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:47.200
Is it good?

46
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:49.130
It's delicious.

47
00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.940
(Ambitious)

48
00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.160
His Highness seems to have asked her,

49
00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.290
but I don't think

50
00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:09.640
he's got the answer yet.

51
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.690
Princess Hua didn't say

52
00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.570
that she...

53
00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:18.610
It has nothing to do with her.

54
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:21.610
Please forgive me.

55
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:22.520
Let's go.

56
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.640
This is nice.

57
00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:32.690
Miss.

58
00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.200
You and His Highness are so strange.

59
00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:37.490
Why?

60
00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.570
Ba told me

61
00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.440
that whenever His Highness sees you...

62
00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.170
I think so, too.

63
00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:50.400
However,

64
00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:51.930
I think it must be because

65
00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.490
His Highness is too nervous.

66
00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:54.930
After all,

67
00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:56.080
if he loses the Hua family's

68
00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.760
hostage,

69
00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:57.690
my father

70
00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:59.640
will definitely cut off his hands.

71
00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.730
It's not as simple as that.

72
00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.880
I am enlightened.

73
00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:06.250
Besides,

74
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.010
this time, the mastermind

75
00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:09.440
is very careful.

76
00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:10.880
I followed them all the way

77
00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.490
and I almost made a move,

78
00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:13.320
but I still

79
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.880
didn't get a single
valid piece of Intel.

80
00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.760
By the way,

81
00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:18.520
I ran into someone this time.

82
00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.880
Who?

83
00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:21.520
He Yuanting.

84
00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:24.200
He Yuanting?

85
00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.200
The second prince of Jinpo

86
00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:27.490
is actually in the capital?

87
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.170
Is he a friend or foe?

88
00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:30.960
I don't know either.

89
00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.730
I think

90
00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:33.200
I should always be wary of this person.

91
00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:34.640
After all, he'd lost

92
00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:35.810
to me once before.

93
00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.130
So he wouldn't just let it slide.

94
00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:40.250
Then why didn't you

95
00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:41.400
tell His Highness?

96
00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:42.760
What should I tell him?

97
00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:44.200
I can't tell him

98
00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:45.570
that I pretended to be
sick the whole time

99
00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:46.840
and that I saved Princess Jiamin

100
00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:48.810
when the situation was dire,

101
00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:49.880
then I ran into

102
00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.080
the second prince of Jinpo

103
00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.810
and

104
00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:53.280
let him slip away

105
00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.320
without knowing.

106
00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.400
Every one of them is a deceitful crime.

107
00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:00.280
So,

108
00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:01.080
although

109
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:02.400
my relationship with His Highness

110
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:03.730
has eased up,

111
00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:04.930
it's not yet

112
00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:06.170
to the point where

113
00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:07.760
I can trust him completely.

114
00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.440
So I'll have to wait.

115
00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:11.080
Most importantly,

116
00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.440
I'd like to know

117
00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:13.570
what exactly

118
00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:14.930
He Yuanting is planning

119
00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.610
to turn the tide.

120
00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.130
(I have plucked out)

121
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:19.490
(all the spies the Crown Prince)

122
00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:21.170
(has planted in the capital.)

123
00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:23.280
(Princess, I have done)

124
00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:24.370
(everything you ordered.)

125
00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:32.540
(Blacksmith)

126
00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:45.320
Forgive me,

127
00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.250
Your Highness.

128
00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:55.100
(Tianzi Number Five)

129
00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:21.610
Your Highness.

130
00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:22.760
You're finally here.

131
00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.930
Did something happen?

132
00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:27.880
Yes.

133
00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.960
Princess Hua was kidnapped

134
00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:31.960
and all of our spies in the capital

135
00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:33.200
were busted.

136
00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:36.170
Even my black-armored army

137
00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:37.810
was exposed.

138
00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:40.640
This...

139
00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:43.520
What's on your mind?

140
00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:50.320
Since the black-armored army

141
00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:51.570
was sent to rescue Princess Hua,

142
00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:53.730
then it's not surprising that

143
00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:54.810
they were exposed,

144
00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:56.170
but why

145
00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:57.440
all the spies also caught?

146
00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:59.200
That's the question.

147
00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:01.960
Actually,

148
00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:03.490
I do have

149
00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:04.440
a doubt.

150
00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:04.840
What?

151
00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:08.760
Yun Han.

152
00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.960
You know my personality best.

153
00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:12.080
When I have doubts,

154
00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:13.370
I check repeatedly.

155
00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:15.440
After carefully verifying

156
00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:17.080
and having been convinced,

157
00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.010
I will trust it

158
00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:20.440
forever.

159
00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:23.250
Of course I know.

160
00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:25.200
I've been with you for a long time.

161
00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:26.730
Of course I'm faithful.

162
00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:29.760
By the way,

163
00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.400
how are you and A'Wa going?

164
00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:35.520
Don't worry, Your Highness.

165
00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:37.090
When I get out,

166
00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:39.010
I'll come back with loads of Intel.

167
00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:39.970
After all

168
00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:41.040
I am

169
00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:42.280
a trustworthy person.

170
00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:46.680
Your Majesty.

171
00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:48.160
It was only after

172
00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:50.010
the kidnapping of Princess Hua
and Princess Jiamin,

173
00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:52.560
as well as your punishment
on the Crown Prince

174
00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:53.640
that it became clear

175
00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:54.640
the number of

176
00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:56.160
His Highness' personal forces

177
00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:57.970
was so large

178
00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.920
and strong.

179
00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:01.250
I believe

180
00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.450
that this matter must
be investigated closely

181
00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.040
to prevent any danger.

182
00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:07.160
With such a number of
black-armored army,

183
00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.210
what I would like to know is

184
00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:12.450
what His Highness is planning to do

185
00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.370
with the army in the capital.

186
00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:20.920
My bad.

187
00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:23.730
It's my fault.

188
00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:27.850
I instructed the Crown Prince
to make the arrangements.

189
00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:29.640
So what do you think

190
00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:31.330
I'm up to?

191
00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:34.250
Your Majesty.

192
00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:38.280
This is not a matter
to be taken lightly.

193
00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:40.130
Please think twice, Your Majesty.

194
00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.680
- Please think twice, Your Majesty.
- Please think twice, Your Majesty.

195
00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:49.160
I didn't take it lightly.

196
00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:51.130
If you can all have

197
00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:52.490
some of your personal wealth,

198
00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.010
is it

199
00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.250
wrong for me to have

200
00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:57.160
my own people?

201
00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:59.760
Let's not mention this matter again.

202
00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:01.010
I believe

203
00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:03.040
the most important thing at this moment

204
00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:04.920
is the safety of Princess Hua.

205
00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:06.010
Tell me.

206
00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:07.640
If anything happens to her,

207
00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.970
how should I explain to General Hua?

208
00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:12.610
All right.

209
00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.610
That's all for now.

210
00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:16.850
I've told you so many times,

211
00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.210
but you just wouldn't listen.

212
00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:19.160
It just went in one ear

213
00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:20.130
and out the other.

214
00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:22.130
Do you understand

215
00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:23.040
my efforts?

216
00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:25.210
If I hadn't covered for you,

217
00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:26.970
how would you have
explained to the officials?

218
00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:28.730
Also,

219
00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:30.450
why did you...

220
00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:32.330
Enough.

221
00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:33.760
I just hope you don't

222
00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:34.920
get into any more trouble.

223
00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:39.920
Father.

224
00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:41.490
If you are not satisfied

225
00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:43.330
with what I have done,

226
00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:44.800
how about you taking over?

227
00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:49.090
Is that how you

228
00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:50.040
admit your mistakes?

229
00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:51.280
Tell me.

230
00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:52.520
Why did you deploy

231
00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:53.610
all the black-armored army?

232
00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:56.010
It was a matter of great urgency.

233
00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:57.800
If we couldn't even

234
00:10:57.850 --> 00:10:58.400
protect a lady,

235
00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:00.010
the glory and peace of our state

236
00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:01.130
might only

237
00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:02.490
be superficial.

238
00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:03.680
You...

239
00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:04.450
Father.

240
00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:06.370
I'm frustrated, too.

241
00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:08.040
I know that it takes a lot of time

242
00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:09.010
to raise an army,

243
00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:11.800
but this time

244
00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.400
we've suffered a lot of losses.

245
00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:16.330
I may not even be able to

246
00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:19.160
get married.

247
00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:21.280
Then you should find a wife.

248
00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:22.730
Grand Preceptor Du's granddaughter

249
00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:23.760
seems nice to me,

250
00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:25.010
but you don't like her.

251
00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:27.400
Forget it.

252
00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:29.090
I don't want to marry someone

253
00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:30.010
and leave her in the harem,

254
00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:32.370
only to be ended up like my mother.

255
00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:41.610
If I were to marry,

256
00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:43.730
either I or she

257
00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:46.850
should be strong enough.

258
00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:51.130
Then you should get married quickly.

259
00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:53.610
I'm afraid I don't have

260
00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:54.730
much time...

261
00:11:58.330 --> 00:11:59.250
Forget it.

262
00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:01.330
You won't agree

263
00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:02.850
to anything I say anyway.

264
00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:06.210
The knots in your heart...

265
00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:16.400
I know very well.

266
00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:31.860
(Minister's Mansion)

267
00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:43.460
(Grand Preceptor Du's granddaughter)
Miss, welcome.

268
00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:44.180
(Du Xiuying)

269
00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:45.490
Thank you, Uncle Wang.

270
00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:55.800
Xiuying.

271
00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.040
Don't you usually

272
00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:58.250
stay at home?

273
00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:00.010
Why did you come to see me today?

274
00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:02.330
I've been studying behind closed doors.

275
00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:03.640
I heard that

276
00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.370
you saved Princess Hua
a couple of days ago.

277
00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:07.130
I wonder if you were hurt.

278
00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:09.400
So I came to see you today.

279
00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:11.160
Are you all right?

280
00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:13.250
Xiuying.

281
00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:14.850
You're the first person

282
00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:16.520
to ask me if I'm all right.

283
00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:19.520
Seeing you're so lively,

284
00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:21.850
I assume you're fine.

285
00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:23.560
I'm relieved then.

286
00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:25.130
I'm glad you're fine.

287
00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:27.160
Did you tell her?

288
00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.180
(Yun Han)
I'm with you every day.

289
00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:31.610
Who is this?

290
00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:33.370
Xiuying.

291
00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:34.680
This is mine.

292
00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:37.090
My father has been trying to

293
00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:38.160
pick a husband for me.

294
00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.040
So I brought it here
for Minmin to review it.

295
00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:42.160
Wenyin.

296
00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:43.450
You can't choose a husband

297
00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:44.880
just by his looks.

298
00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:46.330
It's useless.

299
00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:48.280
You will have a hard time in the future.

300
00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:49.800
No.

301
00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:51.920
He's talented.

302
00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:52.730
Great, then.

303
00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:54.160
Your Highness.

304
00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:55.640
Your Highness.

305
00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:56.760
Princess Hua was invited

306
00:13:56.850 --> 00:13:57.730
to come.

307
00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:58.640
Your parents

308
00:13:58.680 --> 00:13:59.880
want you to go over.

309
00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:02.010
Hua Liuli?

310
00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:06.970
I have a toothache.

311
00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:09.280
Why so suddenly?

312
00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:10.610
It's not like you're

313
00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:11.640
as delicate as Hua Liuli.

314
00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:13.280
If I say I have a toothache,

315
00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:14.920
can I not go?

316
00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:16.970
You should treat others with honesty.

317
00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:18.010
Don't lie.

318
00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:21.490
I'll go then.

319
00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:22.850
You must go.

320
00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:24.370
You are her saviour.

321
00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:25.250
Why should you fear her?

322
00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:26.210
You know what?

323
00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:27.330
She must be displeased

324
00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:28.250
by all the praise you've been

325
00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:29.520
receiving in the capital lately.

326
00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:31.520
She may have come with bad intentions.

327
00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:33.760
How can Princess Hua

328
00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:35.450
be so unreasonable?

329
00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:36.520
Exactly.

330
00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:38.010
Xiuying, listen.

331
00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:38.880
You have to

332
00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:40.090
teach her

333
00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:41.280
core value in Confucianism,

334
00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:42.490
and the virtues of women.

335
00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:44.090
You have to stand up for us.

336
00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:45.010
What?

337
00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:46.610
No need, Xiuying.

338
00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:47.490
Really.

339
00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:48.160
She is...

340
00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:48.970
Why not?

341
00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:50.010
Just leave it to Xiuying.

342
00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:51.210
Let's get going.

343
00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:52.450
Xiuying, let's go.

344
00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:53.850
- But...
- Come on.

345
00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:55.330
I have a headache.

346
00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:56.520
(What kind of)

347
00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:58.370
(a person is this Princess Hua?)

348
00:14:58.640 --> 00:14:59.040
Come on.

349
00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:00.010
So lovely.

350
00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:01.160
- This pink
- Hurry up.

351
00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:02.250
matches what

352
00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:02.970
I'm wearing today.

353
00:15:03.490 --> 00:15:04.490
Princess Hua.

354
00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:07.250
Jiamin has saved you for days

355
00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:08.250
and you're only here now.

356
00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:09.370
This is too much.

357
00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:15.280
I'm sorry.

358
00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:17.010
It's my fault.

359
00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:17.760
No.

360
00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:19.370
As you know,

361
00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:20.730
I am not in good health.

362
00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:22.210
I was traumatised

363
00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:23.010
when I came back.

364
00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:24.920
So I went home to rest for a few days.

365
00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:26.800
I've been busy with the court

366
00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:28.210
for the past two days.

367
00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:29.210
I've managed to

368
00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:30.490
spare some time today

369
00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:32.610
to come and thank you.

370
00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:35.400
Jiamin.

371
00:15:36.090 --> 00:15:38.680
Are you blaming me?

372
00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:40.010
Why should I?

373
00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:41.040
What are you doing?

374
00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:46.490
It's all right.

375
00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:47.280
I am here.

376
00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:48.680
They won't bully you.

377
00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:50.850
You may not

378
00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:52.160
be familiar with me.

379
00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:54.090
My name is Du Xiuying,

380
00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:55.490
Jiamin's cousin.

381
00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:57.250
Just call me by name.

382
00:15:58.210 --> 00:15:59.520
Nice to meet you, Sister Xiuying.

383
00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:00.520
Don't call me sister.

384
00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:02.330
You are from a great family.

385
00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:04.040
I don't deserve it.

386
00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:05.250
Did Jiamin

387
00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:06.920
offend you

388
00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:08.330
just now?

389
00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:09.330
No.

390
00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:11.450
Since Prince Hua is willing to visit me,

391
00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:12.760
it means she has

392
00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:13.640
no issue with me.

393
00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:15.330
Naturally, I will treat Princess Hua

394
00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:16.250
nicely.

395
00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:17.210
That's great.

396
00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:17.880
Jiamin.

397
00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:19.450
I also brought you something delicious.

398
00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:20.450
Yuan Wei.

399
00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:23.560
This is

400
00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:24.610
dried beef jerky

401
00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:25.800
my father sent me

402
00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:26.800
from Qinghan Prefecture.

403
00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:27.680
Try it.

404
00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:28.490
It's delicious.

405
00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:34.330
Who would want this black

406
00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:35.450
and dried food?

407
00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:36.280
Me.

408
00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:38.250
I like it.

409
00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:39.090
Yummy.

410
00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:40.330
It's delicious.

411
00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:41.730
Take it.

412
00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:42.490
Xiuying.

413
00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:43.880
I'd like to have a word
with Princess Hua.

414
00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:45.970
Xiuying.

415
00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:47.370
Look at this.

416
00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:48.160
Why would she eat it?

417
00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:50.210
Why are you here?

418
00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:51.250
I really didn't reveal

419
00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:51.970
your secret.

420
00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:54.210
I came to thank you.

421
00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:55.280
Otherwise, there will be

422
00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:56.280
a lot of complaints

423
00:16:56.370 --> 00:16:58.090
saying that the Hua family
is not courteous.

424
00:16:58.680 --> 00:16:59.880
You don't have to thank me.

425
00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:00.760
I must.

426
00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:02.370
You don't have to.

427
00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:05.560
Then I'll send you some more

428
00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:06.520
dried beef jerky.

429
00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:07.840
No, thanks.

430
00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:11.360
I'll treat you to milk tea.

431
00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:12.490
You don't have

432
00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:13.520
to queue up.

433
00:17:14.690 --> 00:17:16.320
Don't make me gain any more weight.

434
00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:20.280
Princess Hua is a sweet

435
00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:21.120
and lovely person.

436
00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:22.410
Why did you

437
00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:23.890
describe her as

438
00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:24.840
a disgusting,

439
00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:26.760
rude and arrogant lady?

440
00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:27.800
She...

441
00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:30.360
She just bullied us every day.

442
00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:33.560
I'll bring you to Jinling Garden.

443
00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:34.760
Jinling Garden?

444
00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:36.690
It's a place

445
00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:37.760
that many people like.

446
00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:38.490
Nonsense.

447
00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:39.560
I've never been there.

448
00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:42.210
Jiamin.

449
00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:44.840
What do you mean?

450
00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:46.080
Can't you

451
00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:47.450
just accept

452
00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:49.170
my gratitude to you?

453
00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:50.360
Then I will...

454
00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:51.120
She'll go.

455
00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:53.930
Jiamin.

456
00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:55.650
Don't let others down.

457
00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:56.890
I...

458
00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:58.170
Xiuying.

459
00:17:58.250 --> 00:17:59.600
Why don't you go with us?

460
00:17:59.650 --> 00:18:00.490
No.

461
00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:02.210
She doesn't usually go out.

462
00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:03.450
All right.

463
00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:05.040
Since so many people like it there,

464
00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:06.320
I couldn't miss it either.

465
00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:07.930
Thank you for inviting me.

466
00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:09.600
Come on. Let's go now.

467
00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:10.890
You know what?

468
00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:12.120
- Jinling Garden is a nice place.
- This...

469
00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:13.800
Just put it down.

470
00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:15.360
Let's go.

471
00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:17.040
Minister Tian.

472
00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:20.320
I heard that your daughter,
Princess Jiamin,

473
00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:21.600
has recently become

474
00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:23.970
very close to Princess Hua.

475
00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:32.280
My daughter saved Princess Hua.

476
00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:33.970
She had no choice.

477
00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:36.010
Life is important.

478
00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:37.320
In order to survive,

479
00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:40.410
she had to get on
the good side of Princess Hua

480
00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:41.890
to gain insight.

481
00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:42.970
Yes.

482
00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:46.260
(Yunzhong Hall)

483
00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:47.760
Settle those fallen spies

484
00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:48.970
as soon as possible.

485
00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:50.520
Also,

486
00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:54.040
this is a compassionate
offer to their families.

487
00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:00.320
Regarding the spies,

488
00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:01.520
it is my fault.

489
00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:03.120
Please punish me.

490
00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:11.410
Please rise.

491
00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:19.730
Yun Han.

492
00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:21.650
I never doubted you.

493
00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:24.450
Never in this life.

494
00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:26.520
In this world, there are day and night,

495
00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:28.080
and there are gain and loss.

496
00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:30.250
Not everything will go as planned.

497
00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:32.890
Since I have entrusted
you with this matter,

498
00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:35.560
I shall bear

499
00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:37.410
the consequences that may follow.

500
00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:40.890
Get up.

501
00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:45.560
We need

502
00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:46.730
to think about

503
00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:49.730
what went wrong this time.

504
00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:52.650
Your Highness.

505
00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:53.410
Young Master.

506
00:19:54.450 --> 00:19:56.410
Princess Jiamin and Princess Hua

507
00:19:56.490 --> 00:19:57.970
are outside now.

508
00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:00.040
They said

509
00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:02.410
they want to hear you perform.

510
00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:04.930
(What a bad timing.)

511
00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:07.650
This is the guest room

512
00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:09.040
that Young Master Yun
has arranged for you.

513
00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:09.800
Come on in

514
00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:11.250
and wait here.

515
00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:12.650
Young Master Yun will be here soon.

516
00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:15.650
Wenyin.

517
00:20:16.210 --> 00:20:18.040
Is Young Master Yun really

518
00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:19.520
the one you're going to marry?

519
00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:21.840
You didn't lie to me, did you?

520
00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:25.520
That's not it, Xiuying.

521
00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:26.650
Many people

522
00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:28.600
want to marry him.

523
00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:31.040
So I wasn't exactly lying to you.

524
00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:32.080
Right, Jiamin?

525
00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:33.280
Jiamin.

526
00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:35.890
That portrait is yours, right?

527
00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:38.280
You are a grown-up.

528
00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:39.930
You can't keep coming

529
00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:41.560
to a place like this

530
00:20:41.650 --> 00:20:42.890
to have fun.

531
00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:44.650
It's inappropriate.

532
00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:47.010
You've mistaken. It was Princess Hua...

533
00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:51.080
It was me.

534
00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:53.730
My bad.

535
00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:55.170
It had nothing to do with others.

536
00:20:56.650 --> 00:20:58.600
Since you've come all this way,

537
00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:01.760
- He is Yun Han.
- why don't you listen to a melody?

538
00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:02.930
Sit down.

539
00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:06.040
Xiuying, have a seat.

540
00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:10.170
(Since they want to)

541
00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:11.080
(hear you play a melody,)

542
00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:13.360
(just go along with them.)

543
00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:38.560
(They are mostly vulgar.)

544
00:21:39.210 --> 00:21:40.690
(They won't even notice)

545
00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:42.490
(if I make a mistake.)

546
00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:47.760
What's wrong, Xiuying?

547
00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:49.280
Was it not good?

548
00:21:49.890 --> 00:21:51.010
I'm sorry.

549
00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:52.520
I couldn't

550
00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:53.930
enjoy the music.

551
00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:55.800
I should leave first.

552
00:21:56.170 --> 00:21:57.040
Xiuying.

553
00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:59.730
Xiuying, he played so well.

554
00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:00.970
Especially the last few notes.

555
00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:02.280
I was mesmerised.

556
00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:03.690
I heard that this melody

557
00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:05.450
was created by Yun Han himself.

558
00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:07.170
Amazing.

559
00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:09.210
You're being perfunctory.

560
00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:10.800
So annoying.

561
00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:14.320
Bravo.

562
00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:16.690
You played very well.

563
00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:21.690
Young Master Yun Han.

564
00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:23.280
Why don't you play us

565
00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:24.970
one more of your pieces?

566
00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:29.800
(Could any of them)

567
00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:32.170
(actually appreciate it?)

568
00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:47.560
(This is)

569
00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:50.040
(a much better piece
than the previous one.)

570
00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:52.410
(I wonder why.)

571
00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:03.360
Ladies.

572
00:23:03.650 --> 00:23:05.210
I'm going to get us some

573
00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:05.840
delicious snacks.

574
00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:16.560
Excuse me, may I know...

575
00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:20.080
(Jingxin Hall)

576
00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:21.360
He just ignored me.

577
00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:22.170
Princess Hua.

578
00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:26.080
Your Highness.

579
00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:28.120
I didn't expect you

580
00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:29.490
to be in Jinling Garden.

581
00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:30.730
I think I remember

582
00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:33.250
your promise to me.

583
00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:34.410
Your Highness.

584
00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:35.760
I came here today

585
00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:37.600
to visit Princess Jiamin

586
00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:39.280
and thank her for saving my life.

587
00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:40.490
Since

588
00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:41.970
she wanted to come here so badly,

589
00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:43.690
I came along.

590
00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:45.250
As you know,

591
00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:47.170
I don't have many friends

592
00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:48.360
since I've been in the capital.

593
00:23:48.490 --> 00:23:50.250
So I was reluctant to say no.

594
00:23:50.650 --> 00:23:52.250
Since you've put it that way,

595
00:23:52.450 --> 00:23:53.930
I think you're right.

596
00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:56.170
I get it.

597
00:23:56.730 --> 00:23:57.600
However,

598
00:23:58.170 --> 00:23:59.600
Jinling Garden

599
00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:01.560
will be closed for a while.

600
00:24:03.650 --> 00:24:05.360
Is it because of me?

601
00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:06.840
(That's not exactly wrong.)

602
00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:08.280
Soon,

603
00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:08.930
the envoys

604
00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:10.170
will arrive in our state.

605
00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:10.970
If they

606
00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:12.250
misunderstand that our people

607
00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:13.690
only indulge in pleasures,

608
00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:15.360
won't it bring disgrace to our state?

609
00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:17.840
You got a point.

610
00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:20.600
Besides, you own

611
00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:22.170
this Jinling Garden.

612
00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:23.840
It's good to give it a rest.

613
00:24:27.970 --> 00:24:28.840
Did you get it?

614
00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:31.360
Would you

615
00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:32.690
rather

616
00:24:32.890 --> 00:24:34.560
I didn't know?

617
00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:35.650
(Forget it.)

618
00:24:35.730 --> 00:24:36.970
(I can't fool her anyway.)

619
00:24:37.410 --> 00:24:37.930
Forget it.

620
00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:40.010
I didn't intend to hide it either.

621
00:24:40.410 --> 00:24:41.690
(He's quite frank.)

622
00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:43.080
Your Highness.

623
00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:45.170
I snuck out

624
00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:46.360
actually

625
00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:47.800
to find you.

626
00:24:47.970 --> 00:24:49.930
I didn't expect to meet you here.

627
00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:53.970
I swear.

628
00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:55.690
What I just said

629
00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:57.040
is true.

630
00:24:57.690 --> 00:24:58.970
(She is sharp-witted.)

631
00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:00.690
Then would you

632
00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:02.120
like to join me for a cup of tea?

633
00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:04.320
(Great.)

634
00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:07.520
What is this Hua Liuli up to again?

635
00:25:07.650 --> 00:25:08.840
Where has she been sneaking off to?

636
00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:12.360
Greetings, Your Highness.

637
00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:14.410
The Supreme Court is
having a routine inspection.

638
00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:16.170
The two of you should not stay here.

639
00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:17.320
Princess Jiamin.

640
00:25:17.410 --> 00:25:18.970
You should go back.

641
00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:21.890
So annoying.

642
00:25:25.930 --> 00:25:27.490
(Where have they all gone?)

643
00:25:27.690 --> 00:25:28.890
(Why haven't they come back?

644
00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:31.600
All of you, come out

645
00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:33.490
to be examined.

646
00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:34.890
Don't miss

647
00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:36.170
a single corner.

648
00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:39.520
(Investigating Jinling Garden
at this time?)

649
00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:42.280
(Could Yun Han's identity)

650
00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:43.320
(have been exposed?)

651
00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:46.690
Young Master.

652
00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:47.970
I'll go out and see

653
00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:48.890
what's going on.

654
00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:51.320
No.

655
00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:52.490
I...

656
00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:55.280
I can't be found by them.

657
00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:57.600
(What should I do)

658
00:25:57.890 --> 00:25:59.250
(if grandfather finds out?)

659
00:26:02.250 --> 00:26:03.170
Lady Du.

660
00:26:03.250 --> 00:26:05.010
As the granddaughter
of Grand Preceptor Du

661
00:26:05.250 --> 00:26:07.170
and the most gifted lady in the capital,

662
00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:08.890
you must have

663
00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:10.120
never set foot in a place

664
00:26:10.210 --> 00:26:10.970
like this music workshop.

665
00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:13.560
You're afraid you'll be
scolded by your family

666
00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:15.320
if word gets out.

667
00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:20.080
How do you know who I am?

668
00:26:21.210 --> 00:26:22.450
Don't forget this room.

669
00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:23.210
Check it out.

670
00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:26.690
A person should be open and honest.

671
00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:28.600
Now that I'm here,

672
00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:30.730
I should bear the consequences.

673
00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:32.560
Wait, Lady Du.

674
00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:34.600
I'll take you to a place

675
00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:36.280
where no one will find out

676
00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:37.450
your whereabouts today.

677
00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:42.520
Please come in.

678
00:27:00.010 --> 00:27:01.120
I apologise.

679
00:27:03.250 --> 00:27:04.520
Thank you, Young Master Yun.

680
00:27:06.010 --> 00:27:07.690
Are you trying to say that

681
00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:09.120
we should not have direct
contact with each other?

682
00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:12.080
I...

683
00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:15.560
You should

684
00:27:15.730 --> 00:27:17.360
be more careful.

685
00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:19.280
Otherwise, I will

686
00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:20.930
hold you again.

687
00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:29.840
(I didn't expect to find)

688
00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:32.250
(a place like this in Jinling Garden.)

689
00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:37.360
- Greetings, Your Highness.
- Greetings, Your Highness.

690
00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:38.560
Du...

691
00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:41.040
Yes?

692
00:27:41.170 --> 00:27:42.010
Where are the two people

693
00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:43.010
who were with us?

694
00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:45.010
Don't worry.

695
00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:46.250
The two ladies

696
00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:47.930
have gone on their own.

697
00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:49.120
After all, the guests here

698
00:27:49.170 --> 00:27:50.650
are all of high status.

699
00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:53.280
We dare not be rude.

700
00:27:53.930 --> 00:27:54.340
Yes.

701
00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:56.410
How come they leave on their own?

702
00:27:57.410 --> 00:27:58.250
Maybe

703
00:27:58.320 --> 00:27:59.450
they are close.

704
00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:02.800
But they've just known each other.

705
00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:05.280
So annoying.

706
00:28:09.250 --> 00:28:10.730
Will it really be all right??

707
00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:13.930
His Highness said not to worry.

708
00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:15.120
I didn't dare ask further.

709
00:28:15.930 --> 00:28:16.840
Let's go.

710
00:28:19.450 --> 00:28:20.450
If they really find out

711
00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:21.560
something in Jinling Garden,

712
00:28:21.730 --> 00:28:23.250
will it really be shut down?

713
00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:25.040
I don't think so.

714
00:28:25.410 --> 00:28:27.730
This is the biggest music
workshop in the capital.

715
00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:28.890
If this place were to shut down,

716
00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.210
it would be a waste.

717
00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:32.040
But as I was coming,

718
00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:33.320
I overheard

719
00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:35.210
that this place will be turned into

720
00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:36.250
a gathering place

721
00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:37.450
for envoys in anticipation of

722
00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:38.320
the meeting.

723
00:28:38.410 --> 00:28:40.120
A gathering place for the envoys?

724
00:28:40.210 --> 00:28:40.930
Yes.

725
00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:42.320
They also hired

726
00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:43.930
many musicians from outside the region

727
00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:45.250
to ease

728
00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:47.280
the homesickness of the envoys.

729
00:28:56.210 --> 00:28:56.840
Lady Du.

730
00:28:59.120 --> 00:28:59.800
Please.

731
00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:12.970
Have a seat.

732
00:29:24.210 --> 00:29:25.010
Lady Du.

733
00:29:25.450 --> 00:29:26.930
Do you have any prejudice

734
00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:29.170
against Jinling Garden?

735
00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:31.490
I...

736
00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:33.730
I...

737
00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:37.760
I want to apologise to you.

738
00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:39.650
I've heard rumours about Jinling Garden.

739
00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:41.930
So I do have a
prejudice against this place.

740
00:29:42.170 --> 00:29:44.120
Later on, I heard you play the melody

741
00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:45.970
and make a few mistakes.

742
00:29:46.410 --> 00:29:48.410
I thought you were a fraud,

743
00:29:49.650 --> 00:29:50.930
but when I heard it again,

744
00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:52.450
I realised that you might have

745
00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:54.120
done it on purpose.

746
00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:56.730
I was being narrow-minded.

747
00:29:58.730 --> 00:29:59.320
Please forgive me.

748
00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:00.320
Jinling Garden

749
00:30:00.410 --> 00:30:02.010
is a really elegant place.

750
00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:04.520
Well,

751
00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:06.730
not exactly.

752
00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:14.930
Lady Du.

753
00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:17.210
I'll see you out.

754
00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:18.650
Your family

755
00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:19.930
may be worried.

756
00:30:21.210 --> 00:30:22.890
Thank you, Young Master Yun.

757
00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:25.650
Please.

758
00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:45.040
Lady Du.

759
00:30:45.690 --> 00:30:47.010
If you don't mind,

760
00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:49.250
I'd like to play another melody for you.

761
00:30:50.170 --> 00:30:51.840
Since you know music,

762
00:30:52.450 --> 00:30:54.320
I will never make a mistake again.

763
00:31:08.010 --> 00:31:08.970
Thank you, Your Highness.

764
00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:18.120
So?

765
00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:20.170
It's sweet.

766
00:31:26.730 --> 00:31:27.410
You've been

767
00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:28.450
looking around.

768
00:31:29.250 --> 00:31:30.490
Have you found anything?

769
00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:33.890
I'll take a wild guess then.

770
00:31:34.490 --> 00:31:35.760
Jinling Garden

771
00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:37.210
is actually your

772
00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:38.690
information monitoring facility.

773
00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:40.250
All musicians

774
00:31:40.450 --> 00:31:41.600
are trained

775
00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:43.120
to gather the Intel.

776
00:31:43.410 --> 00:31:44.560
The last time

777
00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:46.040
Princess Jiamin and I disappeared,

778
00:31:46.250 --> 00:31:48.250
this must have been

779
00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:49.280
the first place you went.

780
00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:52.170
Also, you told me

781
00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:52.840
that this place

782
00:31:52.890 --> 00:31:54.210
will be open to the envoys.

783
00:31:54.410 --> 00:31:56.490
You are very far-sighted.

784
00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:57.840
You've found out

785
00:31:58.170 --> 00:31:59.210
all my secrets.

786
00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:00.650
This is nothing.

787
00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:01.650
I am

788
00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:03.080
on your side anyway.

789
00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:06.890
Your Highness.

790
00:32:07.410 --> 00:32:09.210
Can you also

791
00:32:09.410 --> 00:32:11.360
share the information you obtained

792
00:32:11.410 --> 00:32:13.410
with me, the Ceremonial Officer?

793
00:32:14.690 --> 00:32:15.280
Sure.

794
00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:19.560
Your Highness.

795
00:32:19.930 --> 00:32:21.360
It's time for me to go back.

796
00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:23.170
The ladies are waiting for me.

797
00:32:23.890 --> 00:32:24.600
I'll see you off.

798
00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:25.600
No.

799
00:32:25.690 --> 00:32:27.120
I can leave on my own.

800
00:32:29.650 --> 00:32:30.800
Your Highness.

801
00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:33.170
We have a long time to come.

802
00:32:42.210 --> 00:32:43.730
(A long time to come?)

803
00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:54.280
(Taoran Hall)

804
00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:55.120
Xiuying.

805
00:32:55.210 --> 00:32:55.890
Princess Hua.

806
00:32:56.010 --> 00:32:57.320
Why did you come out?

807
00:32:58.170 --> 00:32:58.930
Just now,

808
00:32:58.970 --> 00:33:00.490
many officials came.

809
00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:02.450
I got panicked and wandered off.

810
00:33:02.490 --> 00:33:03.650
Then I ended up here.

811
00:33:05.730 --> 00:33:07.250
Yun Han is out, too.

812
00:33:08.890 --> 00:33:09.690
I see.

813
00:33:09.890 --> 00:33:11.360
You were together.

814
00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:12.280
No.

815
00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:15.250
I was in a panic

816
00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:16.410
and worried that my
family would be furious

817
00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:18.040
if they found out I was here.

818
00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:19.930
So I asked for his help.

819
00:33:20.410 --> 00:33:21.320
In fact,

820
00:33:21.410 --> 00:33:22.210
I was also

821
00:33:22.210 --> 00:33:23.250
prejudiced.

822
00:33:23.410 --> 00:33:24.210
I will explain it all to

823
00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:25.840
my grandfather at home.

824
00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:27.320
It was my own idea.

825
00:33:28.690 --> 00:33:29.520
Fine.

826
00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:30.560
I don't know

827
00:33:30.730 --> 00:33:31.930
or see anything.

828
00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:33.280
Well,

829
00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:35.250
now that you've finished chatting,

830
00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:37.410
can we go back?

831
00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:39.080
I'll send you back.

832
00:33:43.010 --> 00:33:44.120
I misunderstood

833
00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:45.520
your kindness.

834
00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:47.280
I apologise.

835
00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:48.760
My family is strict.

836
00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:50.280
So I will stay home to study.

837
00:33:50.730 --> 00:33:51.840
After today,

838
00:33:52.010 --> 00:33:53.410
I think I'll never see you again.

839
00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:55.320
Thank you again for your help.

840
00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:57.280
Goodbye.

841
00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:03.980
(Taoran Hall)

842
00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:11.330
Your Highness.

843
00:34:11.930 --> 00:34:13.930
Why did you bring her into that room?

844
00:34:14.330 --> 00:34:15.330
Please rest assured, Your Highness.

845
00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:16.080
She didn't

846
00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:17.330
find out anything.

847
00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:20.120
Besides, the situation was pressing.

848
00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:21.160
I should not interfere

849
00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:22.600
you and Princess Hua.

850
00:34:24.370 --> 00:34:25.410
You got a point.

851
00:34:26.370 --> 00:34:27.080
By the way,

852
00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:29.120
if Lady Du were to choose a husband,

853
00:34:29.850 --> 00:34:31.600
which young man would she choose?

854
00:34:32.450 --> 00:34:33.490
Exactly me.

855
00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:36.200
Would you dare to marry her?

856
00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:41.160
I received a tip-off.

857
00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:43.370
He Yuanting, the second prince of Jinpo

858
00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:44.640
was spotted in the capital.

859
00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:48.520
This is a very serious matter.

860
00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:49.490
I'm afraid I'll need to

861
00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:50.600
find it out personally.

862
00:34:51.890 --> 00:34:52.720
Be careful.

863
00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:53.770
Yes, Your Highness.

864
00:35:01.850 --> 00:35:03.490
(He Yuanting?)

865
00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:05.370
(What is he doing in the capital?)

866
00:35:06.890 --> 00:35:08.160
(What really happened)

867
00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:10.890
(between him and Liuli?)

868
00:35:16.890 --> 00:35:19.010
Jiamin and Wenyin
went back by themselves.

869
00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:20.290
I had no choice

870
00:35:20.490 --> 00:35:22.120
but to trouble Young Master Yun.

871
00:35:23.850 --> 00:35:24.560
Xiuying.

872
00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:26.490
Why did you just tell Yun Han

873
00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:27.970
that you'd never see each other again?

874
00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:29.640
The capital is a small place.

875
00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:31.720
Why can't you see other again?

876
00:35:32.810 --> 00:35:34.200
I won't visit

877
00:35:34.290 --> 00:35:35.600
Jinling Garden again.

878
00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:37.040
Isn't that a place

879
00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:38.410
you can go at will?

880
00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:41.200
Our lives

881
00:35:41.330 --> 00:35:42.370
are full of desires.

882
00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:44.200
We can't just pursue fun.

883
00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:45.680
Fine.

884
00:35:45.890 --> 00:35:47.120
Since you insist,

885
00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:48.240
then you don't have to go there.

886
00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:52.330
By the way,

887
00:35:52.410 --> 00:35:53.520
this is the dried beef jerky

888
00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:54.520
my father brought me

889
00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:55.330
from the border.

890
00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:56.160
This is nothing like

891
00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:57.490
the one from the capital.

892
00:35:57.560 --> 00:35:58.410
It's delicious.

893
00:35:58.520 --> 00:35:59.560
Try it.

894
00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:02.010
Thank you, Liuli.

895
00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:05.120
Liuli.

896
00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:07.010
You must be lonely

897
00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:08.330
in the capital.

898
00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:12.600
Du.

899
00:36:13.410 --> 00:36:14.160
You are so kind.

900
00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:17.860
(Blossoming Wealth)

901
00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:21.040
(Hua Mansion)

902
00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:22.040
I'm fine.

903
00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:22.770
Thank you

904
00:36:22.850 --> 00:36:23.930
for giving me a lift.

905
00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:25.040
No problem.

906
00:36:25.450 --> 00:36:26.410
Liuli.

907
00:36:26.490 --> 00:36:28.330
You must behave yourself.

908
00:36:28.410 --> 00:36:29.600
What if you hurt yourself

909
00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:30.810
running around like that?

910
00:36:30.890 --> 00:36:32.010
You are not in good health.

911
00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:33.200
I got it.

912
00:36:33.970 --> 00:36:34.890
Du.

913
00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:36.560
It's getting late.

914
00:36:37.010 --> 00:36:38.330
You should hurry home.

915
00:36:38.410 --> 00:36:39.600
I'll see you next time.

916
00:36:39.890 --> 00:36:41.330
My family is very strict.

917
00:36:41.490 --> 00:36:42.720
It may be difficult

918
00:36:42.810 --> 00:36:44.040
to get a chance like this again.

919
00:36:44.450 --> 00:36:45.080
However,

920
00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:46.640
I would love to have tea

921
00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:47.560
and talk with you again.

922
00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:49.080
It's a deal then.

923
00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:55.600
Why isn't she back yet?

924
00:36:56.330 --> 00:36:57.290
Yuan Wei.

925
00:36:57.520 --> 00:36:58.410
Miss.

926
00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:00.200
You are finally back.

927
00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:01.810
Why are you looking so flustered?

928
00:37:01.850 --> 00:37:03.200
A letter from your parents.

929
00:37:03.290 --> 00:37:04.330
They're coming back.

930
00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:05.450
Really?

931
00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:07.100
(To Hua Liuli)

932
00:37:16.970 --> 00:37:18.560
I have good news.

933
00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:19.680
My parents

934
00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:20.890
are coming home.

935
00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:22.600
So I'll need you

936
00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:24.160
to clean up the yard today.

937
00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:25.890
Get started.

938
00:37:26.330 --> 00:37:27.560
All right. Let's go.

939
00:37:28.490 --> 00:37:31.080
- Cut it into the shape of a heart.
- Be careful.

940
00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:34.330
Be careful.

941
00:37:34.770 --> 00:37:35.410
Don't worry.

942
00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:36.490
That plaque

943
00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:37.450
needs to be wiped.

944
00:37:37.810 --> 00:37:38.290
Yuan Wei.

945
00:37:38.450 --> 00:37:39.640
You can put the military books

946
00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:41.120
right over there.

947
00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:42.290
Then get some pots of flowers

948
00:37:42.330 --> 00:37:43.160
and put them there.

949
00:37:43.330 --> 00:37:45.160
What else?

950
00:37:47.330 --> 00:37:48.450
Let's get some more

951
00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:49.010
paintings as well.

952
00:37:49.010 --> 00:37:50.120
- Okay. Let's go.
- Let's go.

953
00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:55.340
(Ambitious)

954
00:37:58.970 --> 00:37:59.770
(My dear daughter,)

955
00:38:00.890 --> 00:38:02.290
(I miss you.)

956
00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:05.450
(How are you doing in the capital?)

957
00:38:05.850 --> 00:38:07.520
(When you are away,)

958
00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:10.010
(your mother keeps
lecturing me every day.)

959
00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:11.680
(How I wish you are here)

960
00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:12.930
(to speak for me.)

961
00:38:14.290 --> 00:38:16.370
(I really miss you.)

962
00:38:17.770 --> 00:38:18.560
(Hua Liuli.)

963
00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:20.720

965
00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:23.810
(make any trouble in the capital?)

966
00:38:24.010 --> 00:38:25.600
(Did you humiliate our family?)

967
00:38:25.890 --> 00:38:27.370
(Did you offend others?)

968
00:38:27.490 --> 00:38:28.770
(And did you remember)

969
00:38:28.810 --> 00:38:30.490

972
00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:36.410
(because when I get there,)

973
00:38:36.770 --> 00:38:38.200

(the men who kidnapped Hua Liuli)

984
00:39:31.770 --> 00:39:33.040
(and Princess Jiamin were killed.)

985
00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:39.370
(The sword mark is inches deep.)

986
00:39:39.970 --> 00:39:41.330
(Such a fierce move.)

987
00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:15.010
Young Master Yun Han.

988
00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:16.520
How are you doing?

989
00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:18.520
Ten years ago,

990
00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:19.490
there was a battle called

991
00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:20.970
the Battle of Yuncang Ridge.

992
00:40:21.410 --> 00:40:24.240
I wonder if you have ever heard of it.

993
00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:27.160
What does it have to do with me?

994
00:40:28.370 --> 00:40:30.490
It was only a few years afterwards

995
00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:32.200
that I came to my senses.

996
00:40:32.970 --> 00:40:34.120
In that battle,

997
00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:35.850
the State of Jin suffered great damage

998
00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:38.200
and Jinpo was also shattered.

999
00:40:38.410 --> 00:40:42.040
So it was a toss-up.

1000
00:40:43.370 --> 00:40:44.810
I've looked deeper

1001
00:40:44.890 --> 00:40:46.330
and found a very interesting man

1002
00:40:46.970 --> 00:40:48.680
who is so ambitious

1003
00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:50.930
that he could hurt the foundations

1004
00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:53.410
of two states with a single battle.

1005
00:40:54.290 --> 00:40:56.040
What are you trying to say,

1006
00:40:56.680 --> 00:40:58.200
the second prince of Jinpo?

1007
00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:04.660
(Pretentious Hour)

1008
00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:06.520
Mother.

1009
00:41:09.450 --> 00:41:11.330
I've heard that both Princess Jiamin

1010
00:41:11.370 --> 00:41:12.970
and Princess Hua have been rescued.

1011
00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:15.160
It was a shocking accident.

1012
00:41:15.490 --> 00:41:16.930
I also heard

1013
00:41:17.330 --> 00:41:19.410
that it was Princess Jiamin
who saved Princess Hua

1014
00:41:19.450 --> 00:41:20.600
with her martial arts skills.

1015
00:41:20.810 --> 00:41:23.200
How exactly did she save her

1016
00:41:23.450 --> 00:41:25.240
with such awkward skills?

1017
00:41:25.290 --> 00:41:26.810
I guess no one but her parents

1018
00:41:26.850 --> 00:41:28.040
would believe it.

1019
00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:29.160
Exactly.

1020
00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:32.200
As the saying goes,

1021
00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:33.560
you can't judge a book by its cover.

1022
00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:34.720
Do you also believe it?

1023
00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:36.810
Don't you find it strange?

1024
00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:40.120
It's indeed kind of weird.

1025
00:41:43.490 --> 00:41:44.600
I got it.

1026
00:41:44.970 --> 00:41:46.240
Jiamin must have

1027
00:41:46.330 --> 00:41:47.240
worked so hard

1028
00:41:47.290 --> 00:41:48.290
to get a compliment from me.

1029
00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:50.040
Since I didn't compliment her,

1030
00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:52.040
she got upset and left.

1031
00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:53.330
Mother.

1032
00:41:53.370 --> 00:41:55.040
Do you agree with me?

1033
00:41:57.010 --> 00:41:58.520
