(In the winter of the 30th year
of Changlong,)

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.880

with Jinpo.)

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:03.880

(This should have been)

27
00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.200
(a good thing that
the whole country celebrated,)

28
00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.570
(but certain things and people's
hearts were unpredictable.)

29
00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:26.290
(The civil officials in
the imperial court)

30
00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.690
(were wary of the Hua family's power.)

31
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.690
(They frequently warned the Emperor)

32
00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.040
(of the threat the family
was posing to his throne,)

33
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.570
(making the Emperor)

34
00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.160

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.420
(Changlong Emperor)

36
00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.040
(To quell the rumors)

37
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.940
(and calm people down,)

38
00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.530
(Changlong Emperor
issued an imperial decree)

(to the Hua family's
young daughter, Hua Liuli,)

41
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.810
(and ordered her to
go to the capital first)

42
00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.010
(and experience)

43
00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.600
(the prosperity of the capital.)

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.460
(Eastern Palace)

45
00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.090
(Experience the prosperity
of the capital?)

46
00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.320
(You're just a hostage.)

(After so many years,)

48
00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.040
(are you a friend or a foe?)

(Capital)
Princess Hua.

52
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.160
Princess Hua,

53
00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.250
we have been waiting
here for a long time.

54
00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.130
Please get off the carriage,
Princess Hua.

55
00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.480
- Please get off the carriage.
- Please get off the carriage.

- Princess Hua.

57
00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:02.600
Welcome, Princess Hua!

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.090
Princess Hua.

59
00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:06.780
Welcome, Princess Hua!

60
00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.540
Princess Hua!

61
00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:09.980
Welcome, Princess Hua!

62
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:11.250
Miss.

63
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:17.170
Oh dear.

64
00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:18.610
Oh no!

65
00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.640
My young lady has fainted from the wind.

66
00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:25.340
(Capital)

67
00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.180
(Four hours ago)

68
00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.780
(Hua Liuli)
What a grand event!

69
00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.740
(Four hours ago)
The Hua family won a great battle!

70
00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.100
(Bai Yun)

71
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.260
(Bai Yun)
Three heads and six arms?

72
00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:34.280
Do you think she's

73
00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.010
the third His Highness of Vaisravana?

74
00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:38.700
(Hei Tu)
Protector General's daughter

75
00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:39.820
(Hua Liuli)
looks just like this.

76
00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:40.900
(Hua Liuli)
I'm certainly right.

77
00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.140
Take a look at this.

78
00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:43.520
All right. I'll buy one.

79
00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.130
Take a look!

80
00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.520
They'll be gone once they're sold out!

81
00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.760
Give me one.

82
00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.050
Princess Hua's portraits!

83
00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:50.520
Limited supply!

84
00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.320
(Hua Liuli)
Limited supply!

85
00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.440
Portraits of Princess Hua!

86
00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:55.760
Limited supply!

87
00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:56.880
Come on!

88
00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.520
Give me one.

89
00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.180
(Minister Tian)
Look at these commoners.

90
00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:03.320
We defeated Jinpo.

91
00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.730
Instead of thanking His Majesty,

92
00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:05.880
they are grateful to the Hua family.

93
00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.180
(Assistant Minister Yao)
The Hua family

94
00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:09.490
has a big issue this time.

95
00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.200
What's the point of
buying these portraits?

96
00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:14.520
What we need to do

97
00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.080
is to share His Majesty's worries.

98
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.320
Official Tian, do you have

99
00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.960
any good idea?

100
00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.640
As soon as Miss Hua enters the capital,

101
00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.250
it will be the best opportunity.

102
00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:27.730
We must criticize her.

103
00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:29.930
What if she's elated?

104
00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:31.440
That means she's self-satisfied

105
00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:32.320
and uncontrollable.

106
00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:33.400
What if she is silent?

107
00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:35.250
Then we'll say she's full of discontent

108
00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:36.320
and blaming His Majesty.

109
00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.440
What if she performs

110
00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:38.490
flawlessly?

111
00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:39.930
It will be even more serious.

112
00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.760
Except for the imperial princess,

113
00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.280
who can be called flawless?

114
00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.130
The Hua family actually

115
00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:46.570
trains her like an imperial princess.

116
00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.690
What kind of ambition is this?

117
00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:50.260
(Censor Zhu)

118
00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:51.940
(Censor Zhu)
My dear gentlemen,

119
00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:54.760
the situation is certainly
not that simple.

120
00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.960
It's pointless to talk further.

121
00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:57.610
Isn't it

122
00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:59.580
important

123
00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.300
(Memorial to the Throne)
to make preparation?

124
00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:04.320
That makes sense.

125
00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.880
(Servant of the Hua family, Yuan Wei)

126
00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:22.610
Miss.

127
00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:24.080
We're almost reaching the capital.

128
00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:27.010
Miss.

129
00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:27.610
The Hua family is currently

130
00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:28.930
in a precarious position.

131
00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:29.880
You must remember

132
00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.080
Master and Madam's instructions.

133
00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:32.280
Be careful in your actions

134
00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.170
and keep a low profile.

135
00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:34.840
Understood.

136
00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:36.660
(The young daughter of
the Hua family, Hua Liuli)

137
00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:38.640
(It's my turn to make an appearance.)

138
00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:53.460
(Token)

139
00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:01.250
Master.

140
00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.140
(Secret)
The assassin has entered the capital.

141
00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:05.640
(Righteous Radiance)

142
00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:06.490
Your highness.

143
00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:07.610
An urgent report from the young master.

144
00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:08.960
Read it.

145
00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:09.690
Yes.

146
00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:11.440
Someone created trouble

147
00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:12.760
for Princess Hua on
her way to the capital.

148
00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:13.730
After an investigation,

149
00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:15.170
the culprit is related to Jinpo.

150
00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:16.370
When they enter into the city today,

151
00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:18.080
she may be
assassinated in the market.

152
00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:24.200
The assassin from Jinpo is indeed here.

153
00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.440
Junior Secretary Pei has not
been waiting in vain.

154
00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:28.440
No one can mess

155
00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:29.930
with the person I
summoned back to the capital.

156
00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:31.020
Ba.

157
00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:31.740
Yes.

158
00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:32.570
Get the horse ready.

159
00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:33.320
Yes.

160
00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:41.250
Why isn't he here yet?

161
00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:46.010
His Majesty ordered His Highness
to handle the reception.

162
00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:47.960
Why hasn't he arrived yet?

163
00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:48.960
Yes.

164
00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:49.840
Gentlemen,

165
00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:50.760
is this our first time

166
00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:52.280
dealing with His Highness?

167
00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:53.730
How can he possibly come?

168
00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.200
He just has to put on an act

169
00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:56.570
in front of His Majesty.

170
00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:14.080
With these officials here,

171
00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.840
if the Hua family's young lady
dies on the spot,

172
00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:18.640
the Hua family and Changlong Emperor

173
00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:20.440
will certainly have a falling-out.

174
00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:22.960
The future of Jinpo

175
00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:23.760
rests

176
00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.080
in our own hands.

177
00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:27.010
Brother.

178
00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.200
Lower your voice.

179
00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:32.400
One. Two. Three.

180
00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:33.610
Why isn't Wu here yet?

181
00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:40.680
The Hua family has returned
to the capital in triumph.

182
00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:42.490
We were sent by His Majesty

183
00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:43.880
to welcome you.

184
00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:51.740
(Yanqi Gate)

185
00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:55.820
(Yanqi Gate)

186
00:08:57.940 --> 00:08:59.700
(Supreme Court Junior
Secretary, Pei Jihuai)

187
00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:02.420
(Capital)

188
00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.010
Princess Hua!

189
00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:09.620
Princess Hua!

190
00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:11.020
Princess Hua!

191
00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:12.330
Princess Hua.

192
00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:14.760
You have come all the way
from Qinghan Prefecture.

193
00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:15.970
It must have been a tough journey.

194
00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:17.730
His Majesty extends his grace to you.

195
00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:19.130
Your residence

196
00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:20.760
has been prepared.

197
00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:23.800
We have been waiting
here for quite some time.

198
00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:25.610
We will take you there now.

199
00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:26.760
Five days later,

200
00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:28.490
His Majesty will meet you.

201
00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:31.330
Princess Hua, please
get off the carriage.

202
00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:34.680
- Please get off the carriage.
- Please get off the carriage.

203
00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:53.210
Princess Hua!

204
00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:56.560
Greetings, Princess Hua!

205
00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:58.160
Greetings, Princess Hua!

206
00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:00.370
Princess Hua!

207
00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:01.330
I'm sorry.

208
00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:02.730
I'm not Princess Hua.

209
00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:04.040
I'm a servant from the Hua family.

210
00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:04.920
My name is Yuan Wei.

211
00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:06.580
This...

212
00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:09.090
Yuan Wei.

213
00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:10.280
Miss.

214
00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:12.850
Have we arrived in the capital?

215
00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:14.300
Yes.

216
00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:15.340
The officials are all waiting for you

217
00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:16.100
to switch to another carriage.

218
00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:17.450
Help me to get off.

219
00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:18.560
All right.

220
00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:38.580
- Princess Hua!
- Princess Hua!

221
00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:40.620
Greetings, Princess Hua!

222
00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:43.160
Princess Hua!

223
00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:44.900
Greetings, Princess Hua!

224
00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:45.940
Princess Hua!

225
00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:46.740
Princess Hua!

226
00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:48.060
Greetings, Princess Hua!

227
00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:49.500
Miss.

228
00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:55.160
Oh no!

229
00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:56.400
Something is wrong!

230
00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:58.740
My young lady has fainted from the wind.

231
00:10:59.100 --> 00:10:59.900
What happened?

232
00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:01.220
She fainted due to the wind.

233
00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:01.970
What's going on?

234
00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:02.730
This...

235
00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:04.520
Is the daughter of the Hua family

236
00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.090
this fragile?

237
00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:07.680
I don't know.

238
00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.210
What should we do then?

239
00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:10.880
Should we criticize her

240
00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:12.490
for her poor health

241
00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:13.280
and how she fainted
at the slightest wind?

242
00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:14.450
What's wrong?

243
00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:15.880
Isn't she very powerful?

244
00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.210
Why is she so weak?

245
00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:50.400
Here comes His Highness!

246
00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:51.260
Why does he come?

247
00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:18.850
Withdraw!

248
00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:42.090
(Crown Prince, Ji Yuansu)

249
00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:46.680
Here comes Wu!

250
00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:52.760
Who's this person?

251
00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:01.160
I am a commoner. I'm too excited

252
00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:02.330
upon seeing you, Your Highness.

253
00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:04.090
I admire your magnificent presence

254
00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:05.210
and cannot control myself.

255
00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:06.500
So...

256
00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:07.450
Hit him.

257
00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:08.760
Your Highness!

258
00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:10.010
Please listen to my explanation!

259
00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:27.330
As expected,

260
00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:29.130
His Highness is so cruel.

261
00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:31.680
Don't ever provoke him.

262
00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:34.820
This is the consequence of offending

263
00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:35.700
His Highness.

264
00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:38.700
Take him away.

265
00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:39.800
Miss.

266
00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:41.330
I'm afraid we can't leave

267
00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:42.330
for the time being.

268
00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:49.090
He's coming this way.

269
00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:52.040
Greetings...

270
00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:54.040
Greetings, Your Highness.

271
00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:56.160
Miss...

272
00:13:58.560 --> 00:13:59.210
She...

273
00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:01.370
She was knocked out by the wind?

274
00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:05.450
Save her.

275
00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:08.370
Your Highness.

276
00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:09.060
This...

277
00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:10.090
You can't enter.

278
00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:11.280
You can't enter, Your Highness.

279
00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:13.560
Princess.

280
00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:18.450
(We finally meet.)

281
00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:21.210
(She was knocked out by the wind?)

282
00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:24.330
(Her breathing is steady.)

283
00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:26.090
(Is she faking it?)

284
00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:27.280
Princess Hua.

285
00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:28.800
(If you dare to touch me,)

286
00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:30.920
(I won't be polite to you.)

287
00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:31.970
Princess Hua.

288
00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:41.160
(Could it be...)

289
00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:57.130
Oh no.

290
00:14:57.970 --> 00:14:59.880
Miss.

291
00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:04.280
You're so unlucky.

292
00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:06.850
You've just arrived in the capital

293
00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:09.400
yet you encountered such a misfortune.

294
00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:11.250
Do they treat you like this

295
00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:14.010
just because you're from the Hua family?

296
00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:16.160
Miss...

297
00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:17.730
You have no idea.

298
00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:19.560
Miss was taken to the battlefield

299
00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:21.490
while she was still in
her mother's womb.

300
00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:24.210
(Come on.)

301
00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:26.010
If she doesn't go home and rest soon,

302
00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:28.610
I'm afraid...

303
00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:30.970
The Hua family has contributed a lot.

304
00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:31.900
How can their daughter

305
00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:32.740
be treated like this?

306
00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:34.730
She must have had
this condition for a long time.

307
00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:35.220
Yes.

308
00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:36.160
Even if he's the Crown Prince,

309
00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:37.610
he can't bully her like this.

310
00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:40.450
Please, Your Highness,

311
00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:43.250
let Princess Hua return home and rest.

312
00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:44.490
Please, Your Highness.

313
00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:45.880
Please, Your Highness.

314
00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:48.010
Let Princess Hua return home and rest.

315
00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:50.460
Please, Your Highness.

316
00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:52.850
(Hua Liuli, you're something.)

317
00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:54.090
If something really happens

318
00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:54.920
to Princess Hua

319
00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:56.250
here,

320
00:15:56.490 --> 00:15:57.920
it will be hard to explain.

321
00:15:58.160 --> 00:15:58.800
That's right.

322
00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:01.280
Your Highness.

323
00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:04.490
I've had this illness for a long time.

324
00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:07.160
I need to live in a comfortable place

325
00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:08.610
to get better.

326
00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:10.680
That's right.

327
00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:11.920
Didn't His Majesty

328
00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:12.880
prepare a residence for us?

329
00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:13.730
Just go home.

330
00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:14.850
You can rest once you're home.

331
00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:33.090
Since Princess Hua can't adapt
to the environment here,

332
00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:35.400
you should return home
and rest as soon as possible.

333
00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:37.610
However, I think

334
00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:39.040
the residence prepared for you

335
00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:40.640
is too noisy.

336
00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:42.130
Qi and Ba.

337
00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:42.730
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Yes, Your Highness.

338
00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:44.010
Escort Princess Hua

339
00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:45.450
to the residence in
the western suburb of the capital.

340
00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:46.730
It is the best for recuperation.

341
00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:47.640
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Yes, Your Highness.

342
00:16:48.010 --> 00:16:49.280
(The western suburb?)

343
00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:50.920
(What is he up to?)

344
00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:51.370
Why...

345
00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:52.300
Why did he suddenly

346
00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:53.370
change the location?

347
00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:54.330
Princess Hua,

348
00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:55.760
please rest well.

349
00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:58.010
I will also send people to
guard you day and night.

350
00:16:58.370 --> 00:16:59.490
You must not go out again

351
00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:00.250
and catch a cold.

352
00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:01.560
You will meet His Majesty soon.

353
00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:03.060
We are both looking forward

354
00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:04.060
to seeing you again.

355
00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:05.210
Escort Princess Hua.

356
00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:05.980
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Yes, Your Highness.

357
00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:07.930
Thank you, Your Highness.

358
00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:15.040
Come on.

359
00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:18.280
Princess Hua, please rest well.

360
00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:19.490
Rest well!

361
00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:31.210
Welcome, Princess Hua!

362
00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:33.360
Welcome, Princess Hua!

363
00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:35.410
Welcome, Princess Hua!

364
00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:37.980
Welcome, Princess Hua!

365
00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:39.010
Why are they making a turn?

366
00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:40.600
Why aren't they entering Hua Mansion?

367
00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:57.170
Welcome, Princess Hua.

368
00:17:58.010 --> 00:17:59.360
You scared me just now.

369
00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:01.010
His Highness came straight for you.

370
00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:02.970
Did you do anything to him before this?

371
00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:08.600
Did I humiliate or scold him?

372
00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:10.360
I don't think so.

373
00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:13.280
Did I dump him?

374
00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:14.490
I don't think so either.

375
00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:17.210
Then...

376
00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:18.360
Well,

377
00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:20.120
when I was just learning
to write as a child,

378
00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:22.170
I liked to express my thoughts directly.

379
00:18:22.930 --> 00:18:24.170
So I wrote letters to the nobles

380
00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:25.450
my parents knew,

381
00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:27.360
even to the royals.

382
00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:32.210
Miss.

383
00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:33.490
You didn't pretend

384
00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:34.560
to be fragile and gentle

385
00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:35.760
when you were a child.

386
00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:36.970
What do you mean?

387
00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:39.690
Since young, I've always aspired

388
00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:41.690
to be a sickly beauty
remembered throughout the ages.

389
00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:43.660
Hua Liuli

390
00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:44.580
(To Crown Prince)
and I used to write to each other

391
00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:46.300
(To Crown Prince)
for several years when I was young.

392
00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:47.800
I know a little about her.

393
00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:49.360
Seeing her today,

394
00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:50.450
she is completely different

395
00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:51.410
from what was written in the letters.

396
00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:53.040
If this is true,

397
00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:55.010
my effort will be in vain.

398
00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:56.360
(My father gave me)

399
00:18:56.410 --> 00:18:57.280
(a foal,)

400
00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:58.560
(a bow and arrows today.)

401
00:18:58.760 --> 00:18:59.730
(I ran ten laps)

402
00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:00.840
(on the hillside.)

403
00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:02.600
(I heard you didn't even have a cat.)

404
00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:04.010
(You are so pitiful.)

405
00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:06.040
(Then I used the bow and arrows)

406
00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:07.060
(to win the first place.)

407
00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:08.780
(To Crown Prince)

408
00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:10.690
(I sent you a bottle)

409
00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:11.760
(of specially-made poison.)

410
00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:12.690
(It is colorless and tasteless.)

411
00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:15.250
(I named it
Have Diarrhea All the Way Through.)

412
00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:20.520
(Once one is poisoned, it will...)

413
00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:26.340
(To Crown Prince)

414
00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:28.010
(I heard that those wretched people)

415
00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:29.410
(were badmouthing the Hua family again.)

416
00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:31.360
(When I return to
the capital in the future,)

417
00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:32.490
(the first thing I will do)

418
00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:33.730
(is to beat up those civilian officials)

419
00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:35.800
(who keeps complaining to His Majesty.)

420
00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:42.250
How can I believe her?

421
00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:44.410
By the way,

422
00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:47.560
how does His Highness look like?

423
00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:49.120
I was too scared just now

424
00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:51.010
and didn't dare to open
my eyes to look at him.

425
00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:52.800
Miss, we're already at this stage.

426
00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:53.800
Why do you care about that?

427
00:19:54.010 --> 00:19:54.970
What do you know?

428
00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:56.840
His Highness

429
00:19:57.010 --> 00:19:58.250
is obviously well-prepared.

430
00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:00.560
I'll have to think of a way

431
00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:01.650
to deal with him.

432
00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:06.730
Everyone

433
00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:08.170
who is passing by,

434
00:20:08.490 --> 00:20:10.300
today, Master Yun Han has
a new song to perform.

435
00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:11.020
Take a look.

436
00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:12.460
The imperial and county princesses

437
00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:13.500
have come to visit us.

438
00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:15.010
Everyone, come in and take a look.

439
00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:16.970
Welcome to Jinling Garden.

440
00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:22.820
Welcome, Princess Hua.

441
00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:23.970
Your luggage is all here.

442
00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:24.970
The four of you,

443
00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:25.970
stay here.

444
00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:26.760
- Yes.
- Yes.

445
00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:28.040
The rest, follow me.

446
00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:28.890
Wait a minute.

447
00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:30.690
Are you leaving just like that?

448
00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:32.250
You've just arrived in the capital.

449
00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:34.250
Please take good care of yourself
and cultivate your mind and body.

450
00:20:34.410 --> 00:20:35.930
If there's anything
you need, just call us.

451
00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:36.980
Let's go.

452
00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:43.490
Yuan Wei.

453
00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:45.170
I still feel dizzy.

454
00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:47.170
Miss, don't scare me.

455
00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:48.380
Let's go. Hurry up.

456
00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:49.500
Slower. Support me.

457
00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:50.730
All right. Walk slowly.

458
00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:51.410
Let's go.

459
00:20:56.970 --> 00:20:58.360
Miss, they can't see us now.

460
00:20:58.650 --> 00:20:59.690
I know. Let's go.

461
00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:01.120
Let's go inside and take a look.

462
00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:01.940
All right.

463
00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:06.080
This...

464
00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:08.120
This...

465
00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:11.080
Miss.

466
00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:11.970
Look at the grass.

467
00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:13.210
It's almost taller than me.

468
00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:15.170
This indicates that
the land here is fertile.

469
00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:16.320
By spring,

470
00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:17.800
we won't even need to plant grass.

471
00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:21.040
Even if we're hostages,

472
00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:22.800
we shouldn't be treated like this.

473
00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:24.520
All right. Stop complaining.

474
00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:25.690
Let's go there and see.

475
00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:30.800
Miss.

476
00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:31.800
Why did we

477
00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:32.600
come to this place?

478
00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:34.210
Look at this.

479
00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:40.890
Miss.

480
00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:43.320
Do you think there's any
restless spirit in the water?

481
00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:45.320
No restless spirit,

482
00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:49.210
but there is a Yuan Wei.
[*Iris, a type of flower]

483
00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:50.840
Miss.

484
00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:53.040
Look at that.

485
00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:54.360
That's a well.

486
00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:56.410
You can use it anytime.

487
00:21:56.690 --> 00:21:57.760
It's much better

488
00:21:57.890 --> 00:21:58.600
than Qinghan Prefecture.

489
00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:05.120
Miss.

490
00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:06.800
Is this even livable?

491
00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:08.490
All right.

492
00:22:09.170 --> 00:22:10.410
It's better than a camp.

493
00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:14.320
Miss.

494
00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:16.020
Isn't that a character of death?

495
00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:16.700
(Hua)

496
00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:17.460
(Hua)
How many people

497
00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:18.970
did you offend in the capital?

498
00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:20.210
We're

499
00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:21.360
really in trouble now.

500
00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:28.260
(Hua Mansion)

501
00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:31.100
(Hua Mansion)

502
00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:33.410
This reads Hua Mansion.

503
00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:37.930
My father said that

504
00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:39.320
the Hua family had an old mansion

505
00:22:39.490 --> 00:22:40.520
in the western suburb.

506
00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:41.760
This should be it.

507
00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:44.080
The plaque outside

508
00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:46.080
was written by my ancestor.

509
00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:48.010
Unfortunately,

510
00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:50.080
he died on a battlefield

511
00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:52.450
and never had a chance
to come back and see it.

512
00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:54.800
Our family has served in
the military for generations.

513
00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:56.690
We're even willing to relocate
our family to the borderlands.

514
00:22:57.490 --> 00:22:59.010
Yet our ancestral home
has fallen into disrepair.

515
00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:00.650
Miss,

516
00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:01.970
why do they still treat
us with suspicion

517
00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:02.800
even after

518
00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:04.410
our hard-fought victory?

519
00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:05.450
It's simply too much.

520
00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:08.170
It's because they don't know

521
00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:10.360
how difficult it is to win a battle.

522
00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:13.080
With His Highness

523
00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:14.690
meddling in our affairs,

524
00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:17.320
our situation

525
00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:18.650
has become even more difficult.

526
00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:19.930
His Highness

527
00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:21.320
is much more ruthless
than the civil officials.

528
00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:22.210
Miss,

529
00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:23.250
you're so clever.

530
00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:24.080
Don't you know

531
00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:25.360
what His Highness is thinking?

532
00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:27.520
Actually, I don't.

533
00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:29.120
But being

534
00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:30.800
secluded like this

535
00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:32.250
is also

536
00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:33.650
a good thing for us.

537
00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:35.450
What good can come

538
00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:36.730
from this barren place?

539
00:23:38.010 --> 00:23:38.930
All the civil officials say that

540
00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:40.120
the Hua family is too powerful.

541
00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:41.650
They are all watching us like hawks.

542
00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:43.520
You saw it today, too.

543
00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:46.170
So we might as well use

544
00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:47.520
the power of His Highness

545
00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:48.930
to stay here.

546
00:23:49.450 --> 00:23:50.760
It's better than being in the busy city

547
00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:51.890
where we can't do anything

548
00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:53.490
under everyone's watchful eyes.

549
00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:55.360
His Highness is not easy to deal with.

550
00:23:57.560 --> 00:23:58.840
It seems we have to figure out a way

551
00:23:59.170 --> 00:24:00.890
to find out his background.

552
00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:02.170
How do we gather information?

553
00:24:04.170 --> 00:24:04.760
Follow me.

554
00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:15.700
(Jinling Garden's No. 1
Gentleman, Yun Han)

555
00:24:16.690 --> 00:24:17.360
Yuan Wei.

556
00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:20.280
When we arrived today,

557
00:24:20.490 --> 00:24:22.170
didn't we pass by Jinling Garden?

558
00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:24.730
Do you still remember the way?

559
00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:26.280
Of course.

560
00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:29.170
You were just fainting
in public a moment ago.

561
00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:31.080
His Highness's men are still outside.

562
00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:32.730
Yet you are thinking
of seeking pleasure.

563
00:24:33.010 --> 00:24:34.250
Come on.

564
00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:35.840
What kind of person do you think I am?

565
00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:37.970
I've asked around.

566
00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:39.520
The noble women of the capital

567
00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:40.800
all go there.

568
00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:41.930
So, what do you think?

569
00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:43.490
If we want to gather information,

570
00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:45.650
we must surely eavesdrop

571
00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:47.450
on some private information.

572
00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:49.800
I don't believe you.

573
00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:53.450
You...

574
00:24:56.410 --> 00:24:58.320
You actually don't believe me?

575
00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:04.120
You don't even believe

576
00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:06.410
such a delicate and
beautiful young lady

577
00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:07.520
with a kind heart.

578
00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:09.410
Fine.

579
00:25:09.690 --> 00:25:10.890
I'm really upset now.

580
00:25:11.690 --> 00:25:12.800
I'm so upset.

581
00:25:14.730 --> 00:25:16.280
(She's getting into
the character too quickly.)

582
00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:18.010
Miss, I've investigated.

583
00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:19.410
This place is heavily guarded.

584
00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:21.120
I can go out to buy groceries.

585
00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:22.860
As for you...

586
00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:27.040
(Women in the Capital)

587
00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:28.100
(Women in the Capital)
I found it.

588
00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:29.860
(Women in the Capital)

589
00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:31.020
I have a plan.

590
00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:32.560
Miss.

591
00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:33.930
Where did this come from?

592
00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:35.690
It's delivered by a swan goose.

593
00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:37.600
But I don't remember

594
00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:38.840
who sent it to me.

595
00:25:40.650 --> 00:25:41.170
Look at this.

596
00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:42.760
It's all about

597
00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:44.490
the latest fashion

598
00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:46.210
and hairstyles in the capital.

599
00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:46.970
Hurry.

600
00:25:47.490 --> 00:25:48.840
Dress me up according to this.

601
00:25:51.170 --> 00:25:52.450
Find some hairpins.

602
00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:55.010
The last step. Come on.

603
00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:57.860
(Fashionable patterns and designs)
Miss, don't move around.

604
00:25:57.970 --> 00:25:59.500
- It hurts too much.
- Beauty always

605
00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:00.900
comes with a price.

606
00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:02.170
Bear with it.

607
00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:03.080
Come on.

608
00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:13.930
Come on.

609
00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:15.490
Lower your head.

610
00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:24.010
We really have to thank father.

611
00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:25.560
Luckily, when he

612
00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:27.040
went on a date with mother,

613
00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:28.250
they found this ancestral dog hole.

614
00:26:28.890 --> 00:26:30.170
The pictorial book was right.

615
00:26:30.410 --> 00:26:31.490
When a young lady elopes,

616
00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:32.600
she must crawl through a dog hole.

617
00:26:33.170 --> 00:26:33.760
Let's go.

618
00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:36.120
Come on.

619
00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:43.930
Let's go.

620
00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:49.220
(Hua Mansion)

621
00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:51.520
Fresh fruits and vegetables!

622
00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:00.620
(Jinling Garden)

623
00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:15.600
Welcome!

624
00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:16.620
Princess Jiamin

625
00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:17.340
(Minister Tian's daughter, Tian Jiamin)
and Miss Yao,

626
00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:18.220
(Minister Tian's daughter, Tian Jiamin)
you have arrived.

627
00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:19.300
(Assistant Minister Yao's daughter, Yao Wenyin)
Your seats from last time

628
00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:20.420
(Assistant Minister Yao's daughter, Yao Wenyin)
have been prepared for you.

629
00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:22.140
(Jinling Garden)
Please follow me.

630
00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:22.730
Please come inside.

631
00:27:59.930 --> 00:28:01.280
Princess Jiamin and Miss Yao,

632
00:28:01.650 --> 00:28:02.730
your seats are ready.

633
00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:03.490
Please come inside.

634
00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:12.450
Please enjoy your meal.

635
00:28:12.730 --> 00:28:13.730
If you need anything,

636
00:28:13.930 --> 00:28:14.840
just let us know.

637
00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:17.540
(Jingxin Place)

638
00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:19.890
The envoy of Gaochang

639
00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:21.420
departed for Jinpo five days ago.

640
00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:22.780
The purpose of the trip is unknown.

641
00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:24.970
The son of Ministry of Justice
official Fang Yuqiu

642
00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:26.540
(Longjin Street)
met someone secretly on the third day

643
00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:27.980
(Dexing Street)
in Jinling Garden.

644
00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:28.820
(Hua Yingting. Shun'an)
It was attended by ten people.

645
00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:29.820
(Wei Mingyue. Tian Jiamin)
Persia and India signed

646
00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:31.260
(Wei Mingyue. Tian Jiamin)
a border trade agreement

647
00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:34.210
(Yao Wenyin. Du Qingling.)
Hua Army delayed

648
00:28:34.210 --> 00:28:34.980
returning to the capital.

649
00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:37.700
(Hua Liuli)

650
00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:58.140
(Princess Jiamin and
Miss Yao Wenyin are here.)

651
00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:09.820
Your Highness.

652
00:29:15.010 --> 00:29:16.520
Five days later, Hua Liuli
will go to the imperial court.

653
00:29:16.690 --> 00:29:17.930
We need to discuss for countermeasures.

654
00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:23.040
These old fellows

655
00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:24.930
are only capable of this.

656
00:29:25.690 --> 00:29:26.320
Your Highness.

657
00:29:31.170 --> 00:29:32.490
The tea is particularly fragrant today.

658
00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:36.760
I'm glad that I made it in time.

659
00:29:36.970 --> 00:29:37.970
Has the assassin been taken away?

660
00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:39.360
He's taken away.

661
00:29:40.170 --> 00:29:41.210
You are brilliant.

662
00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:43.280
You knew that Princess Hua
would come today

663
00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:44.690
and there would be
a big disturbance at the gate.

664
00:29:45.410 --> 00:29:46.450
Those assassins

665
00:29:46.650 --> 00:29:47.600
were quite capable.

666
00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:49.080
They almost injured Princess Hua.

667
00:29:49.930 --> 00:29:51.890
Luckily, I was there

668
00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:53.040
and I used one move to defeat them.

669
00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:57.450
Today, I can be considered
a hero who saved the beauty.

670
00:29:58.600 --> 00:29:59.360
You are wrong.

671
00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:01.080
It's fortunate that I have you.

672
00:30:04.170 --> 00:30:04.800
Oh, right.

673
00:30:05.210 --> 00:30:06.010
See

674
00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:09.410
if there is blood on this handkerchief?

675
00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:13.730
Just take a look.

676
00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:29.450
This should be

677
00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:30.600
a kind of jam

678
00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:31.650
that was brought
from the Western Regions.

679
00:30:32.170 --> 00:30:33.600
It looks quite real.

680
00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:35.450
Your Highness.

681
00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:37.320
You should have
realized it a long time ago.

682
00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:38.730
You're smart.

683
00:30:38.930 --> 00:30:39.890
Thank you for the compliment,
Your Highness.

684
00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:43.040
Your Highness.

685
00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:44.320
I remember

686
00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:45.450
you told me before

687
00:30:45.970 --> 00:30:48.320
that Princess Hua was
ruthless and cunning.

688
00:30:51.250 --> 00:30:52.170
She acted eccentrically

689
00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:54.730
and had strong martial arts skills.

690
00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:55.600
By the way,

691
00:30:55.930 --> 00:30:56.970
you also told me this.

692
00:30:57.410 --> 00:30:57.970
You said

693
00:30:58.080 --> 00:30:59.360
that she's a woman who
could accomplish great things,

694
00:30:59.690 --> 00:31:00.930
and that she'd come to the capital

695
00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:01.840
to represent the Hua family.

696
00:31:02.930 --> 00:31:04.320
Doesn't that make her more suspicious?

697
00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:06.010
If the Hua family

698
00:31:06.210 --> 00:31:07.450
really has rebellious intentions

699
00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:09.520
as reported in the letter,

700
00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:11.360
then Hua Liuli

701
00:31:12.490 --> 00:31:14.210
behaved very suspiciously today.

702
00:31:16.450 --> 00:31:17.010
We need to investigate it.

703
00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:28.800
Yuan Wei.

704
00:31:29.650 --> 00:31:30.840
Don't you think

705
00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:34.520
we're a bit embarrassing?

706
00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:39.120
At least we're saving manpower

707
00:31:39.410 --> 00:31:40.520
by having the donkey carry us.

708
00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:43.020
(Jinling Garden)

709
00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:43.500
(Jinling Garden)
We're here.

710
00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:46.260
(Jinling Garden)

711
00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:49.080
Miss, are we really going in?

712
00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:51.840
Only by entering a tiger's lair
that one can catch its cubs, right?

713
00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:53.010
Besides,

714
00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:53.890
didn't you want

715
00:31:54.010 --> 00:31:54.760
to have an eye-opener?

716
00:31:59.280 --> 00:31:59.780
Miss.

717
00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:03.900
(Jinling Garden)

718
00:32:09.170 --> 00:32:09.890
Please come inside, both of you.

719
00:32:12.970 --> 00:32:13.930
What's this?

720
00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:15.010
Look at her.

721
00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:15.970
What is she wearing?

722
00:32:17.010 --> 00:32:17.890
Look at that person.

723
00:32:18.490 --> 00:32:19.520
What are they wearing?

724
00:32:20.410 --> 00:32:21.080
Miss...

725
00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:22.360
Miss...

726
00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:22.890
What?

727
00:32:23.970 --> 00:32:24.520
Hua.

728
00:32:25.210 --> 00:32:26.360
I'm nervous.

729
00:32:26.970 --> 00:32:28.650
What are you afraid of?
I'm here for you.

730
00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:30.690
Come on. Let's sit over there.

731
00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:38.080
What's wrong?

732
00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:40.890
My father scolded me yesterday.

733
00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:42.360
He said I came

734
00:32:42.490 --> 00:32:43.760
to Jinling Garden every day.

735
00:32:44.010 --> 00:32:45.320
He wants me to choose
a suitable husband,

736
00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:46.690
but I don't like any of them.

737
00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:49.520
Indeed they are not worth considering.

738
00:32:50.250 --> 00:32:51.320
Spoiled rich kids.

739
00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:52.600
Empty-headed.

740
00:32:52.930 --> 00:32:53.970
Just don't tell your father.

741
00:32:54.170 --> 00:32:55.010
What's the big deal?

742
00:32:55.250 --> 00:32:56.560
I come here secretly, too.

743
00:32:58.250 --> 00:32:58.760
That's true.

744
00:33:00.410 --> 00:33:00.970
Minmin.

745
00:33:01.410 --> 00:33:01.970
Tell me.

746
00:33:02.170 --> 00:33:03.600
Who is the most outstanding man

747
00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:05.040
in the capital?

748
00:33:05.890 --> 00:33:07.010
Of course it's Yun Han.

749
00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:08.970
Only His Highness can compare to him.

750
00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:11.210
Forget about His Highness.

751
00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:12.320
He's a difficult person.

752
00:33:12.730 --> 00:33:14.250
Even my father is afraid of him.

753
00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:16.930
He's lazy all day

754
00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:18.170
and doesn't care about politics.

755
00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:19.760
But he also sets rules for others.

756
00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:21.210
He doesn't allow anyone to be idle

757
00:33:21.410 --> 00:33:22.560
and they must offer advice every day.

758
00:33:22.930 --> 00:33:24.320
My father has to compose
those memorials every day

759
00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:25.360
and it gives him a headache.

760
00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:27.040
Let me tell you.

761
00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:27.800
What is it?

762
00:33:27.970 --> 00:33:28.450
Today,

763
00:33:28.650 --> 00:33:30.080
His Highness threw
the young girl from the Hua family

764
00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:31.120
directly into a deserted house

765
00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:32.120
in the western suburb.

766
00:33:32.730 --> 00:33:33.760
Is it true?

767
00:33:34.410 --> 00:33:35.280
Let me tell you.

768
00:33:36.010 --> 00:33:37.170
My father told me that

769
00:33:37.450 --> 00:33:38.280
this time it was

770
00:33:38.490 --> 00:33:39.520
His Majesty's order,

771
00:33:39.730 --> 00:33:41.120
so His Highness was so arrogant.

772
00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:42.690
Really?

773
00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:44.930
The Hua family has great merit
and is highly respected,

774
00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:46.360
but they refuse to
return from the border.

775
00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:47.970
So His Majesty must be wary of them.

776
00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:49.600
This time, the Hua family

777
00:33:49.890 --> 00:33:51.410
is in big trouble.

778
00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:54.410
What are you saying?

779
00:33:57.010 --> 00:33:58.280
How dare you do this.

780
00:33:58.320 --> 00:33:59.220
I...

781
00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:00.120
What?

782
00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:01.250
- You...
- What do you mean?

783
00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:06.560
It turns out you are a country bumpkin

784
00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:07.450
with uncivilized behavior.

785
00:34:11.290 --> 00:34:12.490
Look at your attire.

786
00:34:13.450 --> 00:34:14.240
No one would even dress like this

787
00:34:14.450 --> 00:34:15.720
ten years ago.

788
00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:18.040
When did Jinling Garden become a place

789
00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:19.640
where anyone could come in?

790
00:34:19.890 --> 00:34:21.600
She even offended Princess Jiamin.

791
00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:23.240
Who is this young lady?

792
00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:24.200
You...

793
00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:27.410
(Not only you insulted the Hua family,)

794
00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:29.290
(you also mocked my appearance.)

795
00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:31.640
(It's simply too much.)

796
00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:35.850
Sister,

797
00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:37.680
you're so fierce.

798
00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:39.890
You scared us all.

799
00:34:40.330 --> 00:34:41.330
Sister?

800
00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:43.240
I am your Senior Jiamin.

801
00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:44.890
Where did you come from?

802
00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:46.080
How dare you speak to me like this.

803
00:34:46.290 --> 00:34:47.560
Are all the noble women

804
00:34:47.770 --> 00:34:48.490
of the capital

805
00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:49.970
this arrogant?

806
00:34:50.410 --> 00:34:52.330
You talk about the Hua family

807
00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:53.490
in public and broad daylight.

808
00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:54.970
She's Princess Jiamin.

809
00:34:55.370 --> 00:34:56.520
Every woman in the capital

810
00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:57.970
is emulating her.

811
00:34:58.330 --> 00:34:58.930
So what

812
00:34:59.370 --> 00:35:00.160
if I talked

813
00:35:00.330 --> 00:35:01.240
about the Hua family?

814
00:35:02.010 --> 00:35:02.900
The Hua family is probably...

815
00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:03.580
Sister,

816
00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:04.770
I have limited knowledge.

817
00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:05.970
I don't know

818
00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:07.600
if this is considered

819
00:35:07.890 --> 00:35:09.330
commenting on imperial court affairs.

820
00:35:09.330 --> 00:35:09.810
I...

821
00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:10.560
Minmin.

822
00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:11.560
It wouldn't be that.

823
00:35:11.890 --> 00:35:12.600
Esteemed guests,

824
00:35:12.930 --> 00:35:14.680
please save face for
our small establishment.

825
00:35:15.290 --> 00:35:16.080
Yun Han

826
00:35:16.330 --> 00:35:17.850
will be on the stage soon.

827
00:35:18.810 --> 00:35:19.680
Dear distinguished guests,

828
00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:21.410
would you like me to take you

829
00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:22.490
to a quieter place?

830
00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:23.160
No.

831
00:35:23.330 --> 00:35:24.330
Why should we be the ones to move?

832
00:35:24.370 --> 00:35:25.080
Why not you?

833
00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:25.810
Thank you.

834
00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:28.370
Please, this way.

835
00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:37.450
All right, Minmin.

836
00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:39.810
Don't be angry.

837
00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:41.560
Come on. Sit down.

838
00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:42.890
Have some tea.

839
00:35:42.970 --> 00:35:43.680
My cloak has fallen off.

840
00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:46.720
Yun Han will be on stage soon.

841
00:35:46.970 --> 00:35:48.160
Call me if you need anything.

842
00:35:48.410 --> 00:35:49.010
Thank you.

843
00:35:49.010 --> 00:35:49.720
Have some tea.

844
00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:51.850
Miss, why did you stop me?

845
00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:52.680
Let me fight them

846
00:35:52.890 --> 00:35:53.680
for 300 rounds.

847
00:35:53.890 --> 00:35:54.640
Don't forget that

848
00:35:54.850 --> 00:35:56.040
we're here to gather information.

849
00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:57.770
If you keep arguing with her,

850
00:35:58.330 --> 00:35:59.850
won't it arouse suspicion?

851
00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:03.160
That lady

852
00:36:03.370 --> 00:36:04.640
seems to have a powerful background.

853
00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:06.370
Her parents are either rich or noble.

854
00:36:06.850 --> 00:36:07.970
It seems she is prominent.

855
00:36:08.810 --> 00:36:09.890
Pay close attention.

856
00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:15.900
(Princess Jiamin argued with
an unknown person at Jinling Garden.)

857
00:36:20.810 --> 00:36:21.890
Your Highness, what are you doing?

858
00:36:22.370 --> 00:36:23.370
I'm just getting some fresh air.

859
00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:25.640
Your clothes, Your Highness.

860
00:36:25.850 --> 00:36:26.770
Your mask, Your Highness!

861
00:36:34.770 --> 00:36:35.930
Why is it so dark here?

862
00:37:00.370 --> 00:37:01.490
It's Yun Han.

863
00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:23.600
Yun Han!

864
00:37:23.890 --> 00:37:25.080
Yun Han!

865
00:37:29.330 --> 00:37:30.240
Yun Han!

866
00:37:38.970 --> 00:37:39.780
Yun Han!

867
00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:42.460
(Jinling Garden musician, Yun Han)

868
00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:55.640
Yun Han!

869
00:37:55.810 --> 00:37:56.770
Yun Han!

870
00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:42.740
(This is not the time)

871
00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:43.720
(to be infatuated.)

872
00:38:44.410 --> 00:38:45.640
(Take the opportunity to look around.)

873
00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:48.290
(Find someone to inquire about.)

874
00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:11.600
(Find a musician.)

875
00:39:11.810 --> 00:39:13.560
(Could be one who looks good.)

876
00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:15.290
(And find a small room)

877
00:39:15.450 --> 00:39:16.410
(to talk to him in detail)

878
00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:18.410
(about the current situation
of officials in the capital.)

879
00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:19.850
(Why do I feel as if)

880
00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:21.240
(there's something wrong?)

881
00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:27.380
Excuse me.

882
00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:28.020
Dear guest,

883
00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:29.240
are you looking for someone

884
00:39:29.890 --> 00:39:30.600
or the way out?

885
00:39:31.410 --> 00:39:32.490
(His voice)

886
00:39:32.890 --> 00:39:34.290
(sounds a bit familiar.)

887
00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:40.040
Of course I'm here to find someone.

888
00:39:41.010 --> 00:39:41.930
Dear musician,

889
00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:44.580
I wonder if you have time

890
00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:45.410
to chat with me.

891
00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:49.600
Sure. Why not?

892
00:39:50.450 --> 00:39:51.200
Dear guest,

893
00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:53.120
please come this way.

894
00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:04.980
(Pretentious Moments)

895
00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:08.940
(Fashionable Patterns and Designs)
Ouch, it hurts.

896
00:40:09.290 --> 00:40:10.600
Miss, you scared me!

897
00:40:10.850 --> 00:40:11.330
Here.

898
00:40:11.330 --> 00:40:12.490
You poked my scalp!

899
00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:13.850
Just bear with it.

900
00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:14.600
There.

901
00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:16.240
How's that?

902
00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:18.260
It should be about the same

903
00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:19.520
as the one in the book, right?

904
00:40:20.770 --> 00:40:22.520
What a stunning beauty.

905
00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:25.370
A peerless beauty that would make
the moon hide and flowers wilt.

906
00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:27.450
Yuan Wei.

907
00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:28.240
Tell me.

908
00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:30.290
Who is the most delicate and frail

909
00:40:30.410 --> 00:40:31.680
sickly beauty in this world?

910
00:40:31.890 --> 00:40:33.810
The one who is
the most pitiful and lovable?

911
00:40:36.010 --> 00:40:38.600
Of course it's you, Miss.

912
00:40:40.370 --> 00:40:41.890
Yuan Wei,

913
00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:43.080
you have only one flaw.

914
00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:45.680
