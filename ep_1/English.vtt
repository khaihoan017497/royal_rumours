17
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.060
(Jinling Garden)

18
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.410
Is this how you treat guests

19
00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:01.880
at Jinling Garden?

20
00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.000
(You really think I'm
a small-time musician.)

21
00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:17.560
The saucer.

22
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.960
Dear guest, please enjoy.

23
00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:28.840
Your figure

24
00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.520
looks more muscular than Yun Han's.

25
00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.170
Your appearance must be decent, too.

26
00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.120
What is your name?

27
00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.360
Dear guest, you can call me Jihuai.

28
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.520
Jihuai.

29
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.010
What about you, dear guest?

30
00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:45.210
How should I address you?

31
00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.120
Just call me Huahua.

32
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:49.120
Alcohol might cloud one's judgement.

33
00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:50.210
I won't drink then.

34
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.520
I'm new in the capital.

35
00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.080
Shall we talk instead?

36
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.640
(She's getting to the point.)

37
00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.360
This place has rules.

38
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.770
I must not overstep the boundaries.

39
00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.080
I see.

40
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:03.770
Well,

41
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.050
can you play a song?

42
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.730
I never make things
difficult for others.

43
00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:19.050
Never mind.

44
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.210
Forget it.

45
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.490
So, what do you want to talk about?

46
00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:23.960
Please take a seat.

47
00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.490
I just saw a noble lady

48
00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.400
in the music hall.

49
00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.080
She was dressed very luxuriously,

50
00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.210
and she occupied the best position.

51
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.360
She looks like this,

52
00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:37.610
with two eyes,

53
00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.490
a nose and a mouth.

54
00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.290
Her head is this big.

55
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.050
There are many flowers on it.

56
00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.840
She looks quite similar to you.

57
00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:49.240
However, her temper

58
00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.640
is very bad.

59
00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:52.120
Who do you think you are?

60
00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.560
I...

61
00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:53.210
What do you mean?

62
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.680
You...

63
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:54.330
What do you mean?

64
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.450
It turns out you are a country bumpkin

65
00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.330
with uncivilized behavior.

66
00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.050
Moreover, she even called herself

67
00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.370
Senior Min

68
00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:03.560
and she went by the name...

69
00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:04.490
Princess Jiamin.

70
00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:21.460
Princess Jiamin.

71
00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:23.350
Her father is Minister of Revenue.

72
00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.000
Her mother is Princess Shun'an.

73
00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:26.590
Among her paternal relatives,

74
00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.400
there are people good
at trading silk and fabric.

75
00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:30.150
Her family is considered
prominent and influential.

76
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.520
Thus, she can afford to be

77
00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.080
arrogant and overbearing.

78
00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.380
What about Minister Tian?

79
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:36.440
He is a typical henpecked husband.

80
00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:38.840
The pastries brought back
from Yun's, Jiangnan.

81
00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.910
Dear, please taste it.

82
00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.270
I don't like

83
00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.400
these sweet and greasy things.

84
00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:43.440
Don't you know?

85
00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:46.000
Didn't you say you want to eat snacks?

86
00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.820
I bought them from afar

87
00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:48.640
but you say you don't like them now.

88
00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.220
You don't eat this and that.

89
00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.020
What do you want to eat?

90
00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.260
The moon in the sky?

91
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.790
Why are you angry with me?

92
00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.840
It's not like I made Mother unhappy.

93
00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.710
Dear, what else would you like to eat?

94
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.340
He's close to Censor Zhu

95
00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:04.180
and Assistant Minister Yao.

96
00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.760
The three of them are known as
the three literati of the state of Jin.

97
00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:10.260
Assistant Minister Yao?

98
00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:11.180
(Although he's weak in the limbs,)

99
00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:12.420
(he likes to play with weapons.)

100
00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:13.580
(He's easily swayed)

101
00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:14.420
(and follows what others do.)

102
00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.260
(He's quite dissatisfied with
the title of the three literati.)

103
00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.110
He believes that they should be called
the three swordsmen instead.

104
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.280
(Assistant Minister Yao
and Minister Tian)

105
00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:22.250
(have always had a close relationship.)

106
00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:23.810
(Their daughters
often visit each other.)

107
00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.420
(Yao Wenyin)

108
00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:26.480
(likes to read storybooks.)

109
00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.210
But her eyesight is not very good.

110
00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:29.650
What about Censor Zhu?

111
00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:31.180
He has only one daughter,

112
00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:32.290
who is still young.

113
00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:33.900
(The whole family loves her dearly,)

114
00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:35.700
(considering her a precious gem.)

115
00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:38.260
Oh, right.

116
00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.460
I just heard

117
00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:41.940
in the music hall

118
00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:44.620
that His Highness is quite handsome

119
00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.500
and comparable to Yun Han.

120
00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.380
What kind of person

121
00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.060
is His Highness?

122
00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.380
(How dare you ask about me.)

123
00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.300
(You're still pretty brave.)

124
00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:01.700
His Highness

125
00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.020
looks plain.

126
00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:05.580
Don't care about that.

127
00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:07.020
He looks plain?

128
00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:09.140
One nose, two eyes

129
00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.900
and a mouth.

130
00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:16.220
In the music hall,

131
00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:17.140
I also heard them saying

132
00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:18.700
that His Highness

133
00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:20.580
is very cruel.

134
00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:21.620
I guess

135
00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:23.380
he has offended a lot of people

136
00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:24.500
in the imperial court.

137
00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:27.220
Dear guest,

138
00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:28.900
you've asked

139
00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:31.380
a very clever question.

140
00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:33.020
What does that mean?

141
00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:34.500
If we talk about having enemies,

142
00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:35.500
His Highness

143
00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.460
has enemies all over the imperial court.

144
00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.140
Princess Hua of the Hua family

145
00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:40.700
is similar.

146
00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:44.460
Everyone

147
00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:45.340
in the imperial court

148
00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:47.020
disapproves of His Highness's conduct.

149
00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:47.740
There are also those who

150
00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.460
want to bring down the Hua family.

151
00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:51.140
They say that the Hua family's influence

152
00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:52.460
has already become a threat.

153
00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:55.460
May I ask you?

154
00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:57.820
Are His Highness and Princess Hua

155
00:06:58.140 --> 00:06:59.460
friends or foes?

156
00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:02.460
Are you really a musician?

157
00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:03.260
Are you

158
00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:04.820
really here to listen to music?

159
00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:11.900
Of course I came to listen to music.

160
00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:14.140
We had a wonderful conversation today.

161
00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:15.900
I'll look for you again.

162
00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:16.700
I'm leaving now.

163
00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:25.780
Look,

164
00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:27.940
we only talked today.

165
00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:30.140
We didn't drink

166
00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:31.820
nor listen to music.

167
00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:34.020
So I think this...

168
00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:37.460
The money...

169
00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:41.380
Let's leave it at that.

170
00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:42.580
I'll look for you on another day,

171
00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:43.260
Jihuai.

172
00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:02.140
Hurry!

173
00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:02.860
Let's go!

174
00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:03.700
Let's hurry home.

175
00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:06.820
When will we come back?

176
00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:07.780
We'll talk about that later.

177
00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:08.940
Let's go!

178
00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:14.780
Wait.

179
00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:16.940
Where did those two come from?

180
00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:18.900
I'd never met them before.

181
00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:19.700
They seem like outsiders

182
00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:20.900
who just arrived in the capital today.

183
00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:23.020
They just arrived in the capital today,

184
00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:24.580
yet they acted like this.

185
00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:27.580
- Hua Liuli?
- Hua Liuli?

186
00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:31.020
I'll let her know

187
00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:32.980
who rules the capital.

188
00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:39.500
(Hua Mansion)

189
00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:47.740
The beauty of youth is fleeting
and time flows like water.

190
00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:59.820
The grass is lush and
the beauty of a woman is such.

191
00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:16.420
(The capital is dangerous. Watch out.)

192
00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:18.100
(Who are they?)

193
00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:19.860
(How did they know about
the secrets of the Hua family?)

194
00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:24.220
Miss!

195
00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:26.580
We're done for.

196
00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:28.060
- What happened this time?
- We're in big trouble.

197
00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:29.340
Why are you panicking?

198
00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:29.980
I went out

199
00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:31.580
to buy food and charcoal.

200
00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:33.420
However, wherever I went,

201
00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:34.580
they were seized.

202
00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:37.220
Miss, the Chinese cabbage is very fresh.

203
00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:38.540
Government inspection.

204
00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:40.420
Let's see who would
dare to deceive the people

205
00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:41.860
by passing off inferior
goods as superior ones.

206
00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:45.580
I'm not selling it anymore.

207
00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:52.540
Miss, come and have a look.

208
00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:53.460
We grew this by ourselves.

209
00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:55.580
This is good. I'll take it.

210
00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:56.340
All right.

211
00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:58.220
Government inspection.

212
00:09:58.420 --> 00:09:59.460
Who would dare to disobey?

213
00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:06.220
Come and see

214
00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:07.340
fresh vegetables!

215
00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:08.660
I'll take this, this and this.

216
00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:09.580
Pack them all for me.

217
00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:11.940
All right.

218
00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:14.700
I want

219
00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:15.940
all the vegetables here.

220
00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:18.980
All right.

221
00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:20.120
This is outrageous.

222
00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.300
That's what happened.

223
00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:23.460
It turns out to be Princess Jiamin,

224
00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:24.860
that little fat lamb.

225
00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:27.340
Her father is Minister of Revenue.

226
00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:29.420
It's not surprising that
she has some power.

227
00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:30.940
Little fat lamb?

228
00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:32.980
I've inquired about her.

229
00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:34.260
In the future,

230
00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:34.980
we might have

231
00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:36.100
a lot of dealings with her.

232
00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:37.060
Didn't you say

233
00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:38.260
that as long as we kept a low profile,

234
00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:39.420
we could avoid trouble

235
00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:40.820
and nobody would bully us?

236
00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:42.220
That's not important.

237
00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:43.220
What's important is that

238
00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:45.300
we're already so weak.

239
00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:47.460
If anyone steps on us,

240
00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:49.540
I can't be blamed

241
00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:50.740
for stirring up trouble.

242
00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:54.300
(Ankang Garden)

243
00:10:58.940 --> 00:10:59.420
Your Highness.

244
00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:09.860
Princess Jiamin

245
00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:11.460
cut off Hua Liuli's food supply?

246
00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:12.940
Yes.

247
00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:15.340
She's not too foolish after all.

248
00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:17.060
I didn't expose

249
00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:18.820
Hua Liuli's identity for nothing.

250
00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:20.100
Your Highness, you're wise.

251
00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:27.140
(Someone has come forward)

252
00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:28.540
(and helped me test her.)

253
00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:30.940
(Minister Mansion)

254
00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:31.940
Did you

255
00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:34.060
pose as an official
of Ministry of Revenue

256
00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:35.460
and seize the food of the Hua family?

257
00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:36.460
Did you do it?

258
00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:37.860
She provoked me for no reason.

259
00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:39.540
Could I just swallow my pride?

260
00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:40.940
She's just a young lady,

261
00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:42.220
weak and helpless.

262
00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:44.060
She can't even carry anything.

263
00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:45.420
(Princess Shun'an)
How could she have provoked you?

264
00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:46.340
Well.

265
00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:49.580
She was covered in
gold and silver jewelry

266
00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:51.340
and wearing heavy makeup.

267
00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:52.340
She's

268
00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:54.860
just like our door god in winter.

269
00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:56.580
Is it true?

270
00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:58.460
Why did General Wei's daughter

271
00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:00.460
turn out like this?

272
00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:02.540
What a pity.

273
00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:06.220
(Hua Mansion)

274
00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:08.220
Come on. Slow down.

275
00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:10.540
His Highness has ordered

276
00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:12.100
you to rest well, Princess Hua.

277
00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:14.060
Since I arrived in the capital,

278
00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:15.460
I haven't had a chance

279
00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:16.820
to greet

280
00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:17.940
all my uncles yet.

281
00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:19.940
I'm afraid that if I'm rude,

282
00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:21.700
my father will be angry.

283
00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:23.820
Miss.

284
00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:28.340
So, I need to go out for a while.

285
00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:31.700
Just follow me will do.

286
00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:35.820
We also need to trouble you two

287
00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:37.740
to help us move the gifts.

288
00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:39.740
(Hua Mansion)
Hurry up.

289
00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:42.820
Miss.

290
00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:46.820
Miss.

291
00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:48.980
Will it work if we go?

292
00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:52.180
There is a cause for grievance
and a debtor for every debt.

293
00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:53.580
Who seizes our food?

294
00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:54.980
Of course we have to go to them

295
00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:55.820
to demand for food.

296
00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:57.660
However, in Princess Jiamin's family,

297
00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:59.060
one is Minister of Revenue

298
00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:00.820
and the other is Princess Shun'an.

299
00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:02.060
Three members of noble ranks.

300
00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:03.700
Can we handle it?

301
00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:05.220
Three members of noble ranks?

302
00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:06.980
There's seniority, right?

303
00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:07.940
Moreover,

304
00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:09.740
people with such status

305
00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:10.860
can't make things difficult

306
00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:12.180
for me, the extremely delicate

307
00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:13.100
Miss Liuli, can they?

308
00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:24.340
Master, Madam

309
00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:25.580
the carriage from
the Hua family has arrived.

310
00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:26.740
Why is she here?

311
00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:28.820
She said she's here to thank you

312
00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:30.220
for personally receiving
her at the city gate.

313
00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:31.100
Protector General

314
00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:32.580
specifically instructed
her to visit you.

315
00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:33.940
Let's go.

316
00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:34.860
I'm not afraid.

317
00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:35.940
Exactly.

318
00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:37.580
We can't go.

319
00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:39.700
If she visits our home

320
00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:40.700
and becomes our friend,

321
00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:42.460
what will my colleagues think of me?

322
00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:43.340
Tomorrow, at the court assembly,

323
00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:45.060
they will surely attack me.

324
00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:46.860
We absolutely cannot let her in.

325
00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:47.940
Yes.

326
00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:57.060
Why aren't they here yet?

327
00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:57.820
This...

328
00:13:57.940 --> 00:13:59.340
How long has she been waiting?

329
00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:05.220
Miss,

330
00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:06.580
why don't you rest

331
00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:07.580
in the carriage first?

332
00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:08.580
You've

333
00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:10.220
just recovered.

334
00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:12.220
I am the Hua family's daughter.

335
00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:14.340
I still have to observe etiquette.

336
00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:15.980
Yesterday, Uncle Tian

337
00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:17.340
was also waiting at the western suburb

338
00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:18.660
for me for a long time.

339
00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:20.940
My father has repeatedly reminded me

340
00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:22.980
to come and visit Uncle Tian.

341
00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:27.220
Princess Hua has gone

342
00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:28.940
to Minister Tian's house?

343
00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:30.060
It's true.

344
00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:32.700
She moves fast.

345
00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:42.860
Look, Princess Hua

346
00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:44.580
is obedient and honest.

347
00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:45.990
How could Minister Tian

348
00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:46.550
let her wait

349
00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:47.650
for so long?

350
00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:48.760
Exactly.

351
00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:49.840
What's going on?

352
00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:50.340
Yes.

353
00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:51.340
What to do

354
00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:52.220
if anything goes wrong?

355
00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:53.060
I know, right?

356
00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:56.180
(Minister Mansion)

357
00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:57.700
Princess Hua,

358
00:14:57.820 --> 00:14:58.820
please go back.

359
00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:00.420
My master said

360
00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:01.540
he's not available.

361
00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:04.500
I will be standing here

362
00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:05.820
and waiting for Uncle Tian to return.

363
00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:12.180
I can take it.

364
00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:13.940
Where can Minister Tian go

365
00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:15.340
so early in the morning?

366
00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:17.580
He's obviously avoiding her,

367
00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:18.300
right?

368
00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:19.580
- Right.
- Exactly.

369
00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:20.660
I think Minister Tian

370
00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:22.220
is making things difficult for her.

371
00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:23.100
Yes.

372
00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:25.340
Come out.

373
00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:26.740
Come out now.

374
00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:27.660
Come out.

375
00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:28.580
Come out.

376
00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:30.580
Come out.

377
00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:31.940
They've been waiting for so long.

378
00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:34.340
There they are.

379
00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:36.060
Princess Hua.

380
00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:37.820
My master said he's back.

381
00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:38.700
Please come in.

382
00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:40.700
Please.

383
00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:44.460
They are in trouble now.

384
00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:45.860
Yes.

385
00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:47.860
Princess Shun'an

386
00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:48.940
and Princess Jiamin from the Tian family

387
00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:50.340
are both difficult to deal with.

388
00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:51.700
Princess Hua

389
00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:53.340
has picked the wrong opponent.

390
00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:55.060
I didn't mean her.

391
00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:03.060
I'm Liuli. Greetings, Your Highness.

392
00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:04.220
Minister Tian.

393
00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:07.700
So you are Princess Hua.

394
00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:10.700
(Princess Hua, you're too polite.)

395
00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:17.820
I don't feel well.

396
00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:19.340
I just arrived in the capital yesterday

397
00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:20.580
and I am not used to the water and soil.

398
00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:22.340
Luckily, His Highness

399
00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:23.420
let me stay

400
00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:24.740
at the old Hua family mansion.

401
00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:26.860
Today I'm feeling a bit better.

402
00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:28.940
So I came to greet Your Highness

403
00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:30.060
and Minister Tian.

404
00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:31.180
Father and mother,

405
00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:32.180
she's lying.

406
00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:33.460
I saw her yesterday.

407
00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:35.940
Princess Jiamin,

408
00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:36.940
where did you

409
00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:37.860
see me yesterday?

410
00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:38.460
Jinling...

411
00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:46.300
Maybe I was mistaken.

412
00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:50.940
I don't know why,

413
00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:53.100
but Princess Jiamin is hostile to me,

414
00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:55.940
even cutting off our food supply.

415
00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:57.940
Since yesterday,

416
00:16:58.300 --> 00:16:59.820
my servant and I

417
00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:01.940
haven't eaten anything.

418
00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:04.180
The people said

419
00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:06.980
Ministry of Revenue
cut off our supplies.

420
00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:08.620
- How could that be?
- How could that be?

421
00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:09.860
It's impossible.

422
00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:12.700
Of course I won't let the people blame

423
00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:14.100
Ministry of Revenue like this.

424
00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:15.700
So I came here early in the morning

425
00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:17.460
and told them

426
00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:18.940
my father and Minister Tian

427
00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:20.180
have a good relationship.

428
00:17:20.866 --> 00:17:22.986
- Yes.
- So people won't think too much.

429
00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:26.980
This child is really good.

430
00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:28.940
She even thinks about us.

431
00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:30.460
That's what I should do.

432
00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:31.860
Moreover, my mother said

433
00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:32.940
we must come to visit

434
00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:34.020
Princess Shun'an

435
00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:35.180
in the capital.

436
00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:35.940
Really?

437
00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:37.700
Did General Wei really say that?

438
00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:38.660
Absolutely.

439
00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:39.940
Speaking of that,

440
00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:42.460
Princess Shun'an is a bit different.

441
00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:43.700
Although she is a princess,

442
00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:45.700
she admires General Wei,

443
00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:46.860
the Marquise Chang'an very much.

444
00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:50.140
My mother repeatedly reminded me

445
00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:51.620
to observe the proper etiquette.

446
00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:54.260
That box contains all the gifts

447
00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:55.420
I brought from Qinghan Prefecture.

448
00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:56.780
The gifts are light, but we're sincere.

449
00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:58.620
I hope you'll like them.

450
00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:00.540
This child is very sensible.

451
00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:02.180
It's already hard enough

452
00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:03.380
to come all the way

453
00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:04.740
from Qinghan Prefecture.

454
00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:06.260
Why bring gifts, too?

455
00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:08.260
You're really obedient and sensible.

456
00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:09.940
You're unlike my Minmin

457
00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:10.740
who spends money

458
00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:11.940
recklessly.

459
00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:13.460
She doesn't know how to cherish

460
00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:14.700
this good life we have today.

461
00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:15.380
It's not...

462
00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:16.740
You can praise her,

463
00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:17.980
but why are you scolding me?

464
00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:18.780
How do you know

465
00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:19.700
that she isn't pretending?

466
00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:21.020
Show me how you would pretend.

467
00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:21.740
I...

468
00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:24.220
Don't talk nonsense.

469
00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:26.940
Princess Hua, you haven't
had breakfast, right?

470
00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:27.940
I haven't.

471
00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:29.020
Let's go together.

472
00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:30.460
After breakfast,

473
00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:32.420
I'll take you around the estate

474
00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:33.740
and see if there's anything you like.

475
00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:35.380
I'll give it to you as a gift.

476
00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:40.220
Eat more.

477
00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:43.460
Eat more.

478
00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:46.660
Your Highness,

479
00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:48.420
this is so delicious.

480
00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:50.420
This is so delicious.

481
00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:52.500
Your Highness,

482
00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:54.020
you don't know

483
00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:55.660
how hard it is for my parents

484
00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:56.500
to guard the border.

485
00:18:57.140 --> 00:18:58.140
If they could eat

486
00:18:58.220 --> 00:18:59.380
something this delicious,

487
00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:00.980
they would wake up laughing every day.

488
00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:02.700
Is it that precious?

489
00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:03.940
It is.

490
00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:10.140
Your Highness.

491
00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:13.740
I can't eat anymore.

492
00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:14.740
What's wrong?

493
00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:16.940
If I become too picky,

494
00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:18.220
I can't keep coming here every day

495
00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:20.540
to eat at your house.

496
00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:22.980
Why not?

497
00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:23.940
You're such a good girl.

498
00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:25.220
If you want to come, just come.

499
00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:26.460
Am I right, Tian?

500
00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:27.940
Yes.

501
00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:29.540
Princess Hua, if you like it,

502
00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:30.460
eat more.

503
00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:32.020
If you can't finish it, take it home.

504
00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:33.620
Dig in.

505
00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:34.380
Yuan Wei.

506
00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:36.020
Look at Her Highness

507
00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:37.020
and Minister Tian.

508
00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:38.460
They're so good

509
00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:40.220
and merciful.

510
00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:41.500
They save all beings.

511
00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:42.420
Yes.

512
00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:43.460
Thank you, Your Highness.

513
00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:44.620
Thank you, Minister Tian.

514
00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:46.420
Thank you, Princess Jiamin.

515
00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:48.180
Come on.

516
00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:49.380
Eat more.

517
00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:56.500
Are you full?

518
00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:58.300
If not, don't be polite.

519
00:19:58.300 --> 00:19:59.020
I'm full.

520
00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:00.100
I'm stuffed.

521
00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:01.660
Just treat this place as your home.

522
00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:03.180
Your Highness,

523
00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:04.500
your family really
lives up to its reputation

524
00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:05.980
as a family of silk and satin.

525
00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:07.700
Just look at the fabric

526
00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:08.940
on Princess Jiamin.

527
00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:10.460
It's much better

528
00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:11.740
than anything I've seen before.

529
00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:12.940
Silk and satin?

530
00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:14.500
Minmin has a lot more.

531
00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:15.220
It's all yours.

532
00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:15.580
What?

533
00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:16.460
How can I accept this?

534
00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:16.900
I...

535
00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:17.740
Besides,

536
00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:19.700
I didn't bring any cases.

537
00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:20.220
Come on,

538
00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:21.940
we have many cases here.

539
00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:22.860
Servant!

540
00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:25.020
Come and see if there's
anything else you like.

541
00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:31.460
This tree is so unique.

542
00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:32.620
It's so beautiful.

543
00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:33.420
It's yours.

544
00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:34.740
No.

545
00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:36.980
How can I take it with me?

546
00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:38.700
We have manpower.

547
00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:39.900
Tian.

548
00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:40.460
I'll arrange it.

549
00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:41.940
I'll take you to see something.

550
00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:43.540
This is our treasure house.

551
00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:44.860
Feel free to look around.

552
00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:46.860
So magnificent.

553
00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:53.140
So beautiful.

554
00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:55.020
I've never seen

555
00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:56.740
such a beautiful Night Pearl before.

556
00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:58.620
It's really worthy

557
00:20:58.740 --> 00:20:59.980
of Your Highness
and Minister Tian's mansion.

558
00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:01.500
It's really full of luxury.

559
00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:03.660
Your taste is really good.

560
00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:04.380
Mother,

561
00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:06.140
can you not listen to her nonsense?

562
00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:08.300
She was clearly covered

563
00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:09.420
in gold and silver jewelry yesterday.

564
00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:11.500
Did you see her yesterday?

565
00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:16.700
Princess Hua.

566
00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:19.940
If you like it,

567
00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:22.860
I will give it to you as a gift.

568
00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:25.660
Mother, not this.

569
00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:26.020
This is mine.

570
00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:27.140
What do you mean?

571
00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:30.220
She calls me a merciful
one who helps all beings.

572
00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:32.540
This gift is too expensive.

573
00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:33.700
Your Highness,

574
00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:35.700
you're really good to me.

575
00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:39.220
It'll do as long as you like it.

576
00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:40.220
I like it.

577
00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:43.140
(You've cut off my food supply.)

578
00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:44.220
(You've bullied me.)

579
00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:44.940
(I'll make you regret it.)

580
00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:47.540
(Hua Liuli.)

581
00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:48.660
(Just you wait.)

582
00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:49.900
(This isn't over.)

583
00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:58.160
(Minister Mansion)

584
00:21:58.300 --> 00:21:59.180
Uncle Tian,

585
00:21:59.300 --> 00:21:59.980
you're really kind

586
00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:01.140
to the Hua family.

587
00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:03.140
You've given me so many gifts.

588
00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:04.860
I can't even carry them all.

589
00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:06.780
I'm glad that you like them.

590
00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:09.220
Luckily, you're considerate

591
00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:11.220
and you even sent people
to deliver these things

592
00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:12.420
to my place.

593
00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:17.220
My father was right.

594
00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:19.100
Uncle Tian, you're
really the best friend

595
00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:21.260
of the Hua family in the capital.

596
00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:23.460
Why is Minister Tian

597
00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:24.740
so generous today?

598
00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:26.460
He's usually stingy.

599
00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:27.500
Yes.

600
00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:29.740
It's an eye-opener today.

601
00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:37.020
Be careful, Madam.

602
00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:38.740
This child is really nice.

603
00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:39.500
I like her.

604
00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:40.780
- I really like her.
- Good.

605
00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:44.460
Just these pancakes

606
00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:45.980
in exchange for my Night Pearl,

607
00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:46.860
mother.

608
00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:53.860
They say that the thought counts.

609
00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:54.860
What are you lacking at home

610
00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:55.660
that you expect them

611
00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:56.900
to give you valuable gifts?

612
00:22:58.380 --> 00:22:59.700
General Hua and General Wei

613
00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:01.660
have really raised a good daughter.

614
00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:02.780
She's unlike you,

615
00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:03.900
who's even learnt to deceive people.

616
00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:04.860
When did I deceive anyone?

617
00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:05.940
Stop denying it.

618
00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:07.540
You said she looked like a door god

619
00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:08.370
and bullied her.

620
00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:09.540
You cut off her food supply.

621
00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:10.940
Which door god looks like that?

622
00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:13.860
Next month, your monthly
allowance will be halved.

623
00:23:14.150 --> 00:23:14.740
I...

624
00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:15.940
Father.

625
00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:18.360
Stop complaining.

626
00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:19.300
Even my allowance

627
00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:21.380
may be reduced next month.

628
00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:22.620
It's all your fault.

629
00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:26.980
She took away a lot of stuff?

630
00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:27.940
Yes.

631
00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:29.780
If they didn't let her in,

632
00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:31.460
they'd be criticized by
the people following her.

633
00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:32.900
If they let her in,

634
00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:33.900
people would think

635
00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:35.260
they had a good relationship
with the Hua family.

636
00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:36.020
Other families

637
00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:37.500
have taken the initiative
to send her gifts.

638
00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:39.980
Even Grand Preceptor Du

639
00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:41.500
sent her a bag of charcoal.

640
00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:42.660
There are too many things.

641
00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:44.140
They were all sent
directly to Hua Mansion.

642
00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:45.260
She's

643
00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:46.260
indeed thick-skinned.

644
00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:47.620
However,

645
00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:49.140
Princess Hua also took

646
00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:50.140
some miscellaneous things.

647
00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:52.460
What she needed the most were stones,

648
00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:53.260
trees

649
00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:54.500
and fabric.

650
00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:55.940
I don't know what they are for.

651
00:23:56.740 --> 00:23:57.700
Where is she now?

652
00:23:58.020 --> 00:23:59.340
She is coming towards us

653
00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:00.700
in the direction of Ankang Garden.

654
00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:02.660
Open the gate.

655
00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:04.260
I want to meet her personally.

656
00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:05.500
Understood.

657
00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:13.940
(Let me confront you face to face.)

658
00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:15.940
(Let's see what you have to say.)

659
00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:35.900
(To Crown Prince)

660
00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:39.460
Miss,

661
00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:40.780
His Highness is ahead of us.

662
00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:43.580
Please ask them to take another path.

663
00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:43.940
No.

664
00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:44.980
His Highness is standing at the door

665
00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:46.500
with a few letters in his hands.

666
00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:51.620
(Ankang Garden)

667
00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:53.100
What does he want?

668
00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:55.300
He just won't give up.

669
00:24:58.140 --> 00:24:59.300
You can avoid him on the first day,

670
00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:00.460
but not on the 15th.

671
00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:02.700
Since we can't avoid him,

672
00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:04.420
let's face him head-on.

673
00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:21.020
(That musician said
His Highness looked plain.)

674
00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:22.500
(He's actually good-looking.)

675
00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:24.380
Your Highness.

676
00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:25.900
It has been a day.

677
00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:28.180
Princess Hua, you've already recovered.

678
00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:29.460
Your adaptability is remarkable.

679
00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:32.260
It is truly impressive.

680
00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:34.500
Your Highness, you're so concerned.

681
00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:37.220
I would naturally recover quickly.

682
00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:38.740
I heard that you

683
00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:40.660
went to Minister Tian's mansion today

684
00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:42.140
and made a big gain.

685
00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:43.700
It's quite fruitful.

686
00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:46.620
Your Highness, you've misunderstood me.

687
00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:48.780
I have a reciprocal relationship

688
00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:50.100
with Minister Tian

689
00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:51.600
and Her Highness.

690
00:25:51.910 --> 00:25:52.940
How could I have

691
00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:54.740
made a big gain?

692
00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:57.410
Do you have a gift for me?

693
00:25:58.870 --> 00:25:59.860
(A gift?)

694
00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:01.740
(I didn't even want to come.)

695
00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:04.460
Of course.

696
00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:06.180
Yuan Wei,

697
00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:07.700
take the gift prepared

698
00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:08.980
for His Highness

699
00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:10.620
from the carriage.

700
00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:14.380
Yes.

701
00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:19.980
(You're shameless.)

702
00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:23.740
(It's a waste that
you're so good-looking.)

703
00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:28.700
Which one should I choose?

704
00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:33.220
I'll pick you.

705
00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:38.860
I don't have anything

706
00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:39.980
valuable.

707
00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:40.940
This

708
00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:42.740
is what Her Highness gave me.

709
00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:45.380
It is my most cherished possession.

710
00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:46.300
I

711
00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:47.940
will now give it to Your Highness.

712
00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:54.460
(Baked pancakes?)

713
00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:55.980
(Are you stupid?)

714
00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:57.220
(We finally got precious stuff.)

715
00:26:57.420 --> 00:26:58.220
(Why give it to him?)

716
00:26:58.380 --> 00:26:59.700
(This is already good enough.)

717
00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:04.940
I heard that you

718
00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:06.940
sent a whole box to Minister Tian.

719
00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:09.540
Are you trying to fool me?

720
00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:15.380
If you don't like it...

721
00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:19.700
I have other gifts

722
00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:21.460
for you.

723
00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:29.100
For other families,

724
00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:30.780
I haven't given any money.

725
00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:31.780
The money

726
00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:33.380
can also be given to Your Highness.

727
00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:39.940
You are wealthy.

728
00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:43.220
I don't think you'll be interested...

729
00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:46.740
The money...

730
00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:52.180
(It's him.)

731
00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:54.260
Princess Hua,

732
00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:55.460
I accept your goodwill.

733
00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:56.940
Please have a seat.

734
00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:00.700
(He has a trick up his sleeve.)

735
00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:03.500
(This is not going to be easy.)

736
00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:06.460
Princess Hua.

737
00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:07.940
Just take a look around.

738
00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:09.020
See if there's

739
00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:10.420
anything you like here.

740
00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:11.660
Feel free to take it.

741
00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:15.220
I dare not, Your Highness.

742
00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:17.420
I don't deserve the items
used by you, Your Highness.

743
00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:19.100
They are all imbued with royal aura.

744
00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:21.300
How could I be worthy of them?

745
00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:23.180
Naturally, that's the case.

746
00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:24.900
(When you dig a hole, must I jump in?)

747
00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:25.700
(Don't take me for a fool.)

748
00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:28.700
This is a cat that I've
raised for five years.

749
00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:29.300
Its name is Huahua.

750
00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:30.300
I'm here.

751
00:28:33.090 --> 00:28:33.720
(Oh no.)

752
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.040
Its name is Fafa.

753
00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:38.500
Fafa.

754
00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:41.500
It's a nice name.

755
00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:43.620
Good luck comes to
the house with wealth.

756
00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:44.940
Hello, Fafa.

757
00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:46.260
I'm Huahua.

758
00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:49.260
I still remember

759
00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:50.900
how Princess Hua ridiculed me

760
00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:53.540
for not even having a cat.

761
00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:00.940
What do you mean?

762
00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:03.940
I wouldn't dare

763
00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:06.220
to mock Your Highness.

764
00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:07.220
There must be

765
00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:09.420
a misunderstanding here.

766
00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:12.780
Your Highness,

767
00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:15.020
- (It's indeed a letter from me.)
- Can you do horse riding and archery?

768
00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:16.500
My father gave me

769
00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:17.420
a foal,

770
00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:19.020
a bow and arrows today.

771
00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:20.740
I heard you didn't even have a cat.

772
00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:22.980
You are so pitiful.

773
00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:24.260
(What should I do?)

774
00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:25.420
Then I used the bow and arrows

775
00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:26.460
to win the first place.

776
00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:28.980
The first place in archery?

777
00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:31.340
If I'm not mistaken,

778
00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:33.260
someone said at the city gate

779
00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:34.940
that she was weak and sickly from birth

780
00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:36.940
and had a congenital illness.

781
00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:41.100
Miss.

782
00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:43.300
I did not lie.

783
00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:45.660
It is indeed

784
00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:46.940
a congenital illness.

785
00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:48.220
It's just that

786
00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:50.220
the duration of the relapse

787
00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:51.500
was somewhat long.

788
00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:52.700
I enjoyed

789
00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:54.660
a period of good health.

790
00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:58.980
However, it got out of hand again.

791
00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:01.420
I am very pitiful.

792
00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:02.740
My mother said

793
00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:04.020
when she was pregnant with me,
she went to a battle.

794
00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:05.620
The consequence was that I was born

795
00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:06.940
to fight fearlessly on horseback.

796
00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:07.660
I'm strong and robust.

797
00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:09.740
I've defeated all my opponents
throughout Qinghan Prefecture.

798
00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:14.860
I heard that those wretched people

799
00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:16.700
were badmouthing the Hua family again.

800
00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:18.380
When I return to
the capital in the future,

801
00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:19.260
the first thing I will do

802
00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:20.460
is to beat up those civil officials

803
00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:23.900
who keeps complaining to His Majesty.

804
00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:25.940
I...

805
00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:28.980
I was told by my mother.

806
00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:30.140
So

807
00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:32.100
I always thought

808
00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:33.500
that my body was very healthy.

809
00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:34.860
Later on,

810
00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:37.740
during a battle,

811
00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:39.620
I was poisoned.

812
00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:41.220
- (Continue to put on an act.)
- So...

813
00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:42.980
Alright, Princess Hua.

814
00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:44.220
It's cold outside.

815
00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:45.100
Let's go inside.

816
00:30:57.100 --> 00:30:57.700
Princess Hua.

817
00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:00.220
Yes, Your Highness?

818
00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:02.060
We just talked about poison.

819
00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:03.260
Suddenly, I remember

820
00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:03.980
I have a bottle

821
00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:05.540
of the poison you gave me years ago.

822
00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:07.100
I'll show it to you.

823
00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:08.700
Qi and Ba.

824
00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:13.420
I suddenly feel dizzy.

825
00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:15.940
Your Highness, please forgive me.

826
00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:17.260
My body is not well.

827
00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:18.500
I'm afraid I might...

828
00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:22.100
Your Highness,

829
00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:23.100
please forgive me.

830
00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:25.540
Miss is having a relapse.

831
00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:27.300
I'll bring her back to rest.

832
00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:28.220
Let's go.

833
00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:31.460
Miss, are you all right?

834
00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:33.980
(I'll let you go today.)

835
00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:35.500
(We have a long way to go.)

836
00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:38.500
Please bring Junior Secretary Pei over.

837
00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:39.700
I need him.

838
00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:40.460
- Yes.
- Yes.

839
00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:48.660
Miss.

840
00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:50.140
Did you really send His Highness

841
00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:51.500
a bottle of poison?

842
00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:53.140
Are you planning to assassinate him?

843
00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:55.940
I never imagined this.

844
00:31:56.980 --> 00:31:59.260
Instead of dumping him,

845
00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:00.900
I...

846
00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:02.180
You failed to assassinate him?

847
00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:05.980
I just sent letters

848
00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:07.220
to random people then.

849
00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:09.380
I never imagined anyone would reply.

850
00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:11.620
Moreover, he kept them all these years.

851
00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:14.260
It's alright to do that,

852
00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:15.980
but why did you write to His Highness?

853
00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:16.820
I just acted on impulse

854
00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:18.380
at that time.

855
00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:20.860
Besides, I even sent him

856
00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:21.900
a lot of things.

857
00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:24.060
Don't tell me you also sent him

858
00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:25.460
other poison?

859
00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:27.860
We are done for.

860
00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:28.940
(Instead of handling)

861
00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:30.420
(the noblewomen and officials)

862
00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:31.500
(and meeting His Majesty,)

863
00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:33.700
(His Highness suddenly appeared.)

864
00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:37.140
(I'm having a headache for real.)

865
00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:41.220
♪Casting off South Yang
is the main worry♪

866
00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:45.980
♪While making preparation
for the northern expedition♪

867
00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:50.740
♪When the time comes,
heaven and earth will work together♪

868
00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:56.140
♪But the fate of heroes
is not in their own hands♪

869
00:32:56.940 --> 00:32:57.900
Uncle Song.

870
00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:02.540
(A veteran of Hua Army, Song Guang)

871
00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:10.620
When the time comes,
heaven and earth will work together.

872
00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:13.100
But the fate of heroes is
not in their own hands.

873
00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:15.100
This is the poem you loved the most

874
00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:16.420
in Qinghan Prefecture.

875
00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:19.260
You used to recite it to me
when I was young.

876
00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:20.940
Do you think

877
00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:22.220
I would forget them?

878
00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:28.940
Miss, you got the wrong person.

879
00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:30.220
How could I be wrong?

880
00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:34.420
Uncle Song.

881
00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:36.540
I always thought you left the army

882
00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:37.780
and went back home.

883
00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:40.220
I'm in the capital now.

884
00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:41.780
Come back with me to the Hua family.

885
00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:47.500
Miss.

886
00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:49.460
Look at me now.

887
00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:52.100
I'm living a comfortable
and carefree life.

888
00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:54.100
I'm sunbathing and drinking.

889
00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:56.540
Please don't make it difficult for me.

890
00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:05.020
Miss.

891
00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:06.940
What's wrong with Uncle Song?

892
00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:09.500
The Hua family

893
00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:11.700
should be better
than this street, right?

894
00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:14.100
He just doesn't want to burden us.

895
00:34:15.220 --> 00:34:17.020
Back then, he couldn't fight a battle

896
00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:19.260
because of his injury.

897
00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:21.860
So he volunteered

898
00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:22.820
to go back to his hometown.

899
00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:27.860
Let's go home first.

900
00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:30.300
Let me think about it.

901
00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:36.180
(Ankang Garden)

902
00:34:36.180 --> 00:34:36.860
Your Highness.

903
00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:38.660
Are you so sure

904
00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:39.780
that Princess Hua will hire people?

905
00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:43.580
How else can they handle the junk

906
00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:45.700
with just the two of them?

907
00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:48.300
I understand.

908
00:34:49.180 --> 00:34:49.820
However, Your Highness,

909
00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:51.540
we've been watching Princess Hua.

910
00:34:52.140 --> 00:34:53.580
Do you think the civil officials
of the imperial court

911
00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:54.660
will find fault with you?

912
00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:55.820
Am I right?

913
00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:01.220
I am just an idle prince

914
00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:02.540
with a bad temper,

915
00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:03.660
who does not do anything worthwhile.

916
00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:04.740
That way,

917
00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:07.180
doesn't it fulfill
the desire of those people?

918
00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:10.820
Your Highness,

919
00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:12.740
where's Huahua today?

920
00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:13.980
I didn't see it around.

921
00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:15.220
I don't know where it ran off.

922
00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:17.300
Huahua.

923
00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:18.060
By the way,

924
00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:21.340
we should rename it Fafa.

925
00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:22.740
We don't want people to think

926
00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:24.700
that I have any intention
towards Princess Hua.

927
00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:30.100
- Fa...
- Also,

928
00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:32.260
I registered you

929
00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:33.340
for Jinling Garden.

930
00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:35.100
- You registered...
- In case anyone asks you

931
00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:37.460
if you've been a musician...

932
00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:40.360
- This...
- Don't be too surprised.

933
00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:41.980
- Fafa.
- No, this...

934
00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:43.460
What?

935
00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:44.310
Fafa.

936
00:35:44.370 --> 00:35:45.190
A musician?

937
00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:08.140
Miss.

938
00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:09.660
We went through the trouble

939
00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:11.620
and all you got was this stuff.

940
00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:13.620
This is treasure.

941
00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:14.580
Treasure?

942
00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:15.820
Later, I'll draw a picture

943
00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:16.900
and you can place them

944
00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:18.180
in the positions shown in my drawing.

945
00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:19.580
Place them all in positions.

946
00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:21.580
Am I doing it alone?

947
00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:22.900
Do you think that's possible?

948
00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:24.060
Have you forgotten

949
00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:25.180
that those soldiers who were with us

950
00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:26.820
were sent back home by you?

951
00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:30.340
Then just recruit a few more people.

952
00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:31.180
I...

953
00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:32.180
I'll go back to draw.

954
00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:41.660
(Hua Mansion)

955
00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:54.220
Brother.

956
00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:55.980
Are we going to take action tonight?

957
00:36:57.700 --> 00:36:59.220
Of course, the sooner, the better.

958
00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:06.860
Where did this drunkard come from?

959
00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:09.620
Good liquor.

960
00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:10.540
(Hua Mansion)

961
00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:11.820
Good liquor.

962
00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:12.420
Oh no.

963
00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:13.620
He's attracted the guards.

964
00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:14.300
Hide.

965
00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:17.380
It's the Hua Mansion.

966
00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:18.380
Do not approach it.

967
00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:19.740
Drink somewhere else.

968
00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:20.780
Go.

969
00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:46.340
Blame this stupid drunkard.

970
00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:47.100
Retreat.

971
00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:57.660
(Hua Mansion)

972
00:37:57.660 --> 00:37:58.340
Uncle Song.

973
00:37:59.020 --> 00:37:59.860
Thank you for what you did last night.

974
00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:01.260
You kept watch near Hua Mansion.

975
00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:03.100
So the assassins
wouldn't dare to come close.

976
00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:05.540
Although you didn't say it,

977
00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:06.700
I just know.

978
00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:08.100
Miss,

979
00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:10.180
I can drink every day

980
00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:11.300
and bask in the sun.

981
00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:13.260
I'm living a comfortable life.

982
00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:13.860
Uncle Song.

983
00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:14.900
I really don't want this.

984
00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:16.060
Please come with me.

985
00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:17.060
If you don't want to join me,

986
00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:18.060
I won't force you.

987
00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:22.820
Song Guang, listen to my orders.

988
00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:23.620
I'm here.

989
00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:26.780
Song Guang, listen to my orders.

990
00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:27.540
I'm here.

991
00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:29.260
- Song Guang, listen to my orders.
- I...

992
00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:31.220
Miss, stop teasing me.

993
00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:33.700
Uncle Song.

994
00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:35.340
I missed you so much.

995
00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:36.540
Why would I tease you?

996
00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:38.140
Look at you.

997
00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:40.060
You have never forgotten your roots.

998
00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:42.140
You are still the veteran
of the Hua family.

999
00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:46.820
However,

1000
00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:48.780
I'm just a useless person now.

1001
00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:51.020
You are a soldier trained
by the Hua family.

1002
00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:52.100
How could you be useless?

1003
00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:53.780
Are you afraid of burdening me?

1004
00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:55.780
Uncle Song,

1005
00:38:57.220 --> 00:38:58.740
I really need you.

1006
00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:04.100
This is the secret language
of the Hua family.

1007
00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:05.820
(The capital is risky.)
You intended to remind me, didn't you?

1008
00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:09.980
Since you know I'm in danger,

1009
00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:12.220
do you bear to see me struggling alone?

1010
00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:14.580
Yuan Wei has gone to recruit workers.

1011
00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:16.220
I really need

1012
00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:17.340
someone I can trust.

1013
00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:19.580
Uncle Song.

1014
00:39:20.220 --> 00:39:21.980
You know the situation I'm in now.

1015
00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:24.700
Miss.

1016
00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:26.500
Forget it.

1017
00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:39.220
(Hua)

1018
00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:47.580
(Hua)

1019
00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:57.180
(Hua)

1020
00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:14.180
Song Guang, listen to my command!

1021
00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:18.300
I'm here!

1022
00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:31.680
(Hua)

1023
00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:43.140
(Pretentious Moments)

1024
00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:44.700
Fafa.

1025
00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:46.420
Fafa, where are you?

1026
00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:47.300
Fafa.

1027
00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:51.260
Where did you go?

1028
00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:52.860
Fafa.

1029
00:40:55.540 --> 00:40:56.820
I finally found you.

1030
00:40:58.300 --> 00:40:59.220
What's wrong?

1031
00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:01.380
Why are you unhappy?

1032
00:41:02.540 --> 00:41:03.140
Come here.

1033
00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:05.180
Fafa.

1034
00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:09.220
What's wrong?

1035
00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:11.020
Why are you so angry?

1036
00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:14.220
I knew it.

1037
00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:15.380
I bet you dislike

1038
00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:16.700
