17
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.050
The decorations here

18
00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.570
are different from anywhere else.

19
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:48.960
Interesting.

20
00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:01.690
(Why isn't he leaving yet?)

21
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.410
(How would I know?)

22
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.320
(Ask him.)

23
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.200
(I asked several times.)

24
00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.320
(He still won't leave.)

25
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:10.090
(What can I do?)

26
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.720
(Aren't you worried people will say)

27
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.640
(that Prince Ying and Princess Hua
have grown so close)

28
00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:14.850
(after staying in
the same room together?)

29
00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.530
(Don't jinx it.)

30
00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:18.480
Prince Ying.

31
00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:21.090
Yes?

32
00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.290
It's already noon.

33
00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:23.530
Isn't it time...

34
00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:24.570
Is it time for lunch?

35
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.040
I didn't expect you

36
00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.440
to be so hospitable.

37
00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:29.850
Then I shall

38
00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.480
accept your invitation.

39
00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.970
He even wants to eat here.

40
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:37.850
Your Highness.

41
00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.040
Watch your steps.

42
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.880
Don't fall.

43
00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.530
I heard that my brother is dining here.

44
00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.010
I shall join them.

45
00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:46.850
Your Highness.

46
00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.010
Liuli.

47
00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:49.040
You don't mind, right?

48
00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:52.920
I thought you would at least

49
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.880
reflect on yourself

50
00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:54.970
after the plum blossom banquet.

51
00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:56.640
I didn't expect you

52
00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.570
to come here so soon.

53
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.370
I've been whipped a few times

54
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.570
by mother.

55
00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:06.850
The plum blossom banquet

56
00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.250
has frightened Princess Hua.

57
00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.410
Don't worry, Princess Hua.

58
00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.640
I will treat you well.

59
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.090
I won't let you suffer any more harm.

60
00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.690
Who was it at the banquet

61
00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.370
that frightened Princess Hua?

62
00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:21.850
It was mother.

63
00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.040
If it's her fault,

64
00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:25.760
can you just ignore it?

65
00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.130
I didn't.

66
00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.480
I'm here to make amends.

67
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.480
As long as Princess Hua

68
00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.370
stays with me all the time,

69
00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.760
day and night,

70
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.640
she will be safe.

71
00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.420
(Hua Mansion)

72
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.980
It's become more challenging.

73
00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:50.380
There are actually two princes

74
00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:51.480
in Hua Liuli's mansion.

75
00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.040
We can take them down in one go.

76
00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.290
Then we will have

77
00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:55.320
the State of Jin under our control.

78
00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:57.850
Don't you know how many traps there are

79
00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:58.760
in the mansion?

80
00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.160
Take them all down?

81
00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.880
I think

82
00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:01.760
we are the ones in trouble.

83
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:03.640
Didn't Hua Liuli say

84
00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:04.570
she would continue

85
00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:05.600
to deal with us?

86
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.720
Is she

87
00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:08.250
planning to conspire with us

88
00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:09.370
to assassinate that...

89
00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.600
What's wrong?

90
00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:11.920
Conspire with you

91
00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.090
to assassinate herself?

92
00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:16.610
- She did it.
- She did it.

93
00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.760
I can't believe that even my poison

94
00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:33.810
couldn't kill her.

95
00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:37.640
Forget it.

96
00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:39.170
Let's get our act together

97
00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:41.520
and wait for the right time.

98
00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:42.610
Great.

99
00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:44.810
I can finally live longer.

100
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.880
Yes.

101
00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.130
You know

102
00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:07.880
what Jinling Garden looks like

103
00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.490
without ever going out.

104
00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.200
You've even brought

105
00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:12.840
the chief manservant along.

106
00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.200
Your Highness.

107
00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.570
I may be from the border,

108
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.170
but I'm not ignorant of

109
00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.370
things in the capital.

110
00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:21.280
You, on the other hand,

111
00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.760
must have frequented Jinling Garden.

112
00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:36.690
I'm hungry.

113
00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:38.880
What you see before you

114
00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.880
is the daily food

115
00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.400
of the local people at the border.

116
00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.760
They are all very delicious.

117
00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:58.730
What's this?

118
00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:03.130
This is pork offal.

119
00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:11.080
And what is this?

120
00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:12.400
Why does it smell rotten?

121
00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:13.960
This is milk curd.

122
00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:15.930
Is it not available here?

123
00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.130
I'm from a desolate land

124
00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.060
and my family

125
00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:22.840
is poor.

126
00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.370
So

127
00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:25.930
I can only

128
00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:27.400
offer this

129
00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:28.640
to both of you.

130
00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.280
I hope

131
00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:31.730
you don't mind.

132
00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:33.370
Princess Hua.

133
00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.840
Don't you have water here?

134
00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:37.370
You can drink

135
00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:38.810
the pork offal soup

136
00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:39.880
in front of you.

137
00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:41.370
If you don't like it,

138
00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:42.880
you can try the milk curd.

139
00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:48.610
Brother, please.

140
00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:50.810
Your Highness, please.

141
00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:52.520
After you.

142
00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:54.080
I should let you go first.

143
00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.370
What's in that little porcelain bottle?

144
00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.960
This is the vegetable juice I made.

145
00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:04.130
After all, there are many
vegetables grown here.

146
00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:05.640
I will drink this first.

147
00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.280
I like vegetable juice.

148
00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.200
It smells good.

149
00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:13.280
Let me taste it first.

150
00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:21.640
Prince Ying.

151
00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:23.730
Is it bad?

152
00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:26.640
It's good.

153
00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:27.730
I like it.

154
00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:32.370
I'm already full.

155
00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:34.280
Thank you for the meal.

156
00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:35.840
I shall take my leave.

157
00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.050
I'll take my leave first.

158
00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:42.610
Since my brother is not staying,

159
00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:44.200
then I shall leave, too.

160
00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:46.490
Take good care of your body.

161
00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:53.320
Miss.

162
00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:54.490
They've finally left.

163
00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.930
I want to be a feeble woman,

164
00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:01.170
but I don't really want

165
00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.570
to be sick.

166
00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:16.730
Your Highness.

167
00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:18.490
What brings you here all of a sudden?

168
00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:19.730
Father intends

169
00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:21.370
to betroth Princess Hua to me.

170
00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:23.490
It's not appropriate for you to come.

171
00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:25.840
I heard that father was furious

172
00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:27.370
when he found out that Princess Hua

173
00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:28.320
had been poisoned at the banquet.

174
00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:29.490
It seems that

175
00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:30.760
the betrothal will be put aside.

176
00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.610
Father never said so.

177
00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:34.850
It will happen.

178
00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:36.920
Besides, Princess Hua

179
00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:38.490
has already grown fond of me.

180
00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:40.450
She invited me to lunch.

181
00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:42.040
Your Highness.

182
00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:43.730
You should avoid suspicion.

183
00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:45.450
Really?

184
00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:50.160
That won't do.

185
00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:52.940
Father entrusted me to find

186
00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:53.640
the assassin.

187
00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:54.920
Not only do I have to handle the case,

188
00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:56.400
I also have to protect Princess Hua.

189
00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:58.160
You, on the other hand,

190
00:08:58.800 --> 00:08:59.850
it's still uncertain

191
00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:01.220
whether Consort Xian

192
00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:02.620
can be

193
00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:03.560
cleared off the case.

194
00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:06.090
You are the one who
needs to avoid suspicion.

195
00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.520
Miss, eat something.

196
00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:17.640
You are starving.

197
00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:20.920
My head hurts.

198
00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:22.250
I lost my appetite.

199
00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:25.920
Miss.

200
00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:27.620
Why is Prince Ying

201
00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:28.560
so confident?

202
00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.800
He is the Emperor's first son.

203
00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:33.820
Besides, Consort Xian

204
00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:35.130
dotes on him so much.

205
00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:37.280
It's normal that he's so confident.

206
00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:40.560
The only thing is that the Crown Prince

207
00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:42.730
started hiding things for me

208
00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:45.490
at the plum blossom banquet,

209
00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:49.610
which I don't quite get.

210
00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:51.450
Maybe

211
00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.520
he suddenly found out that
you are a good person

212
00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:54.760
and didn't pick on us.

213
00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:56.280
Do you really think so?

214
00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:00.040
Maybe he has ulterior motives.

215
00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:01.730
No one knows what he's thinking.

216
00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:02.620
Anyway, we need

217
00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:03.640
to be more careful.

218
00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:07.370
I still have to be wary of him.

219
00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:13.220
(Jinling Garden)

220
00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:16.420
(Hua Mansion, Western Suburb)

221
00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:19.100
(Hua Liuli)

222
00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:24.380
(Hua Liuli)
(Ji Yuansu)

223
00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:25.760
I don't know

224
00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:27.490
what you're up to,

225
00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:30.970
but I don't think

226
00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:34.280
you're a sinister person.

227
00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:37.640
If the assassins

228
00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.160
were really from Jinpo,

229
00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:41.280
would that prove that

230
00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:43.160
there was no connection between

231
00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:44.730
Princess Hua and Jinpo?

232
00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:46.330
It's complicated

233
00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:47.490
as it is a one-sided story.

234
00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:49.800
It is uncertain yet.

235
00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:53.250
If you really think

236
00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:54.730
that Princess Hua

237
00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:56.560
is not such a sinister person,

238
00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:59.920
why don't you get to know her
in a different approach?

239
00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:04.760
I can change my approach

240
00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:05.640
to know her,

241
00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:07.210
but what do you do?

242
00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:09.680
As one of you men,

243
00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:12.010
I should address your concerns.

244
00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:13.680
I will continue to pursue

245
00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:16.040
the hidden truth about Princess Hua.

246
00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:18.970
If you think there's nothing wrong

247
00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:20.040
with Princess Hua,

248
00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:22.300
don't you blame me

249
00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:23.490
for the wrong intelligence

250
00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:24.610
I gave you in the first place?

251
00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:27.450
Why should I?

252
00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:30.730
Everything that reaches my ears

253
00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:32.330
comes from a wide

254
00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:33.800
variety of sources.

255
00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:35.920
Occasional mistakes are unavoidable.

256
00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:37.520
Besides, this matter

257
00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.280
is not yet settled.

258
00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:41.250
Don't worry about it.

259
00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:47.010
A different approach?

260
00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:54.560
Don't underestimate the youngest
daughter of the Hua family

261
00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:57.400
and the Crown Prince.

262
00:11:57.850 --> 00:11:59.130
Let the assassins of Jinpo

263
00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:00.640
go on their way

264
00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:02.680
so that we can position

265
00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:04.280
our men more securely.

266
00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:06.490
What do you mean?

267
00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:09.210
If the youngest daughter of
the Hua family is really sick,

268
00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:11.680
why has she escaped
harm so many times?

269
00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:16.640
If the Crown Prince is
really a brutal man,

270
00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:18.010
why did His Majesty

271
00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:20.210
grant him the throne?

272
00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:35.040
(He's squinting his eyes.)

273
00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:36.610
(What is he up to again?)

274
00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:39.400
(She's staring at me.)

275
00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:41.560
(What is she up to again?)

276
00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:50.400
Your Highness.

277
00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:52.160
Where are you

278
00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:54.330
taking me today?

279
00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:56.160
You'll know when you get there.

280
00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:58.850
Didn't His Majesty

281
00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:00.280
ask you to investigate

282
00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:01.330
the case?

283
00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:03.970
I'm flattered

284
00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:05.450
that you're spending

285
00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:09.010
so much time on me.

286
00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:10.610
If the assassins

287
00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:11.560
were targeting you,

288
00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:13.660
wouldn't your presence beside me

289
00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:15.330
be their perfect goal?

290
00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:17.130
Then there's no need

291
00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:18.280
for me to look elsewhere.

292
00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:22.250
You got the point.

293
00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:25.520
Your Highness, we are here.

294
00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:29.680
Your Highness.

295
00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:31.370
You may get down first.

296
00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:33.330
I am not in good health.

297
00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:35.040
I will take some time.

298
00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:37.210
Be quick.

299
00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:53.660
(Wrestling Arena)

300
00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:03.490
Princess Hua.

301
00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:05.010
My father used to

302
00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:06.880
bring me here when I was a child.

303
00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:08.970
Have you ever

304
00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:10.560
seen anything like this?

305
00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:18.680
They are fighting.

306
00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:21.610
So barbaric.

307
00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:23.850
Princess Shun'an

308
00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:25.560
has always admired General Wei's talent.

309
00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:27.640
After General Wei went to the border,

310
00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:30.020
Princess Shun'an regularly

311
00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:30.800
held wrestling competitions.

312
00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:33.250
No wonder Princess Shun'an

313
00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:34.610
treats me so well.

314
00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:35.130
By the way,

315
00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:37.560
do you have the same skills

316
00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:38.920
as General Wei in wrestling?

317
00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:43.450
I am not in good health.

318
00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:46.400
I can't overdo myself.

319
00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:49.450
Well, that's a shame.

320
00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:53.450
Bravo. Fight!

321
00:14:58.620 --> 00:14:59.260
Everyone.

322
00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:01.780
The fight between General Hua

323
00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:02.580
and General Wei

324
00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:04.400
is now

325
00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:06.640
remembered by many

326
00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:08.490
as a heroic fight.

327
00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:10.210
Today,

328
00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:11.970
I have invited

329
00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:13.450
Princess Hua,

330
00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:15.210
the daughter of the Protector General,

331
00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:16.250
Marquis Chang'an,

332
00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:18.860
- to be the judge for this match.
- (He's testing me again.)

333
00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:20.560
Let's give her a warm welcome.

334
00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:22.450
(Just don't expose my martial arts.)

335
00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:23.210
No.

336
00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:26.610
What's wrong?

337
00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:31.160
Stop it.

338
00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:33.250
Princess Hua is weak.

339
00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:34.780
How could you bring her

340
00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:35.610
to such a dangerous place?

341
00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:39.090
I'm just asking her

342
00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:40.010
to be a judge

343
00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:40.640
and just stand

344
00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:41.800
comfortably on the stage.

345
00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:43.970
No way.

346
00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:45.370
That's dangerous, too.

347
00:15:45.781 --> 00:15:47.351
It's not.

348
00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:49.560
How can there be no danger

349
00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:51.330
When the wrestlers get into a fight,

350
00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:52.160
they couldn't care less about

351
00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:53.010
the people around them.

352
00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:54.400
What if Princess Hua can't avoid it

353
00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:55.400
and gets hurt?

354
00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:57.880
Princess Hua.

355
00:15:58.490 --> 00:15:59.400
I believe

356
00:15:59.970 --> 00:16:01.490
that a person who has been
brought up in the Hua family

357
00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:03.010
is bold and resolute

358
00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:05.040
regardless of their physical condition.

359
00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:05.940
If you

360
00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:07.210
can't even be a judge,

361
00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:09.920
I'm afraid people will be disappointed

362
00:16:10.090 --> 00:16:11.490
in the two generals.

363
00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:12.250
(He keeps)

364
00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:13.800
(bringing up my parents.)

365
00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:14.970
(He's so cruel.)

366
00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:16.490
(It seems he won't)

367
00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:17.680
(let me slide today.)

368
00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:19.760
In that case,

369
00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:21.160
I will

370
00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:22.920
take on this task.

371
00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:25.210
However,

372
00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:26.880
I am in poor health.

373
00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:28.520
So...

374
00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:29.370
Let's begin.

375
00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:33.610
Princess Hua, be careful.

376
00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:37.250
Great!

377
00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:47.130
May I know your names?

378
00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:48.800
Our names...

379
00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:49.970
Are not worth mentioning.

380
00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:52.730
Start.

381
00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:05.930
Princess Hua.

382
00:17:07.450 --> 00:17:08.970
Be careful, Princess Hua.

383
00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:10.470
Why do those two wrestlers

384
00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:11.110
keep approaching

385
00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:11.970
Hua Liuli?

386
00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:13.910
- Isn't this bullying?
- Hey.

387
00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:16.080
His Highness is so mean.

388
00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:17.840
Why is he torturing Hua Liuli like this?

389
00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:19.360
Torture?

390
00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:20.700
His Highness is doing

391
00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:21.800
the right thing.

392
00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:31.400
Goodness.

393
00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:32.690
Help.

394
00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:41.650
Be careful, guys.

395
00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:45.250
Did you see it?

396
00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:46.940
I think Hua Liuli

397
00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:47.520
threw a kick just now.

398
00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:49.170
Really?

399
00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:51.300
But I didn't

400
00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:52.250
see it clearly.

401
00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:54.120
Hua Liuli

402
00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:55.280
is definitely not an ordinary person.

403
00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:56.730
Princess Hua.

404
00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:01.320
Princess Hua, be careful.

405
00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:02.650
Help.

406
00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:06.690
Princess Hua.

407
00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:16.600
No.

408
00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:18.080
Stop now!

409
00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:21.320
Help.

410
00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:24.650
Princess Hua.

411
00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:25.860
- Princess Hua.
- Prince Ying.

412
00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:27.250
Be careful.

413
00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:29.010
Princess Hua.

414
00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:31.170
Be careful.

415
00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:43.410
Princess Hua, be careful.

416
00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:47.250
(Since you are merciless,)

417
00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:54.560
(don't blame me for being unrighteous.)

418
00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:56.450
(What's going on?)

419
00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:58.280
(Good luck.)

420
00:19:09.170 --> 00:19:10.450
His Highness.

421
00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:15.450
Your Highness.

422
00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:16.650
I am sorry.

423
00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:17.280
Forgive me.

424
00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:19.210
Your Highness, are you all right?

425
00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:23.520
Princess Hua.

426
00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:25.520
You are quite skilled.

427
00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:37.360
(Memorial)
It's all about you.

428
00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:40.930
Father.

429
00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:42.170
I'm just

430
00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:43.410
doing the right thing.

431
00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:46.970
Is that why

432
00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:48.800
you always spend time

433
00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:50.800
at Princess Hua's place?

434
00:19:51.970 --> 00:19:52.730
Of course.

435
00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:55.170
Princess Hua was almost assassinated

436
00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:56.560
at Consort Xian's plum blossom banquet.

437
00:19:56.970 --> 00:19:58.410
I am protecting her.

438
00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:01.080
Still, it's not appropriate

439
00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:02.930
for you to take Princess Hua

440
00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:05.930
to a horse racing track

441
00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:08.120
and a wrestling arena.

442
00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:10.600
I'm responsible for her reception.

443
00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:12.120
I found her homesick.

444
00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:14.320
So I took her to the racetrack

445
00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:15.760
to get over it.

446
00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:17.730
Is it wrong?

447
00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:19.650
I've heard that

448
00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:20.930
the wrestlers

449
00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:23.490
even attacked Princess Hua.

450
00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:24.930
I wonder

451
00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:27.250
what your explanation is

452
00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:28.930
for this?

453
00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:36.120
I'm the one who got hurt.

454
00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:39.250
Do you care for me?

455
00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:47.010
I have my own arrangements

456
00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:48.450
for the investigation.

457
00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:50.410
Do I need to report to you all?

458
00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:52.560
Have you made any progress

459
00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:53.930
with that case?

460
00:20:58.010 --> 00:20:58.650
Yes.

461
00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:01.840
The assassins at the banquet and before

462
00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:03.280
were from Jinpo.

463
00:21:03.650 --> 00:21:04.410
Junior Secretary Pei

464
00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:05.890
has drawn up the official document.

465
00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:10.360
This...

466
00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:15.560
Impossible.

467
00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:19.280
Jinpo soldiers are the most reserved.

468
00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:21.170
How did you get them to talk?

469
00:21:22.690 --> 00:21:23.450
Kill.

470
00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:33.890
I'll beat you to death.

471
00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:35.010
I'll beat you to death.

472
00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:51.170
They killed another one.

473
00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:53.890
It's been several days.

474
00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:57.560
This cell is almost empty.

475
00:21:58.250 --> 00:21:59.410
The State of Jin

476
00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:03.040
is too scary.

477
00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:11.690
Master Pei.

478
00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:12.930
Good job.

479
00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:14.800
Give him extra meal tonight.

480
00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:16.050
- Yes.
- Thank you.

481
00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:16.690
- Thank you.
- Take him away.

482
00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:18.220
Move.

483
00:22:23.690 --> 00:22:24.410
My Lord.

484
00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:26.650
We are not at fault, My Lord.

485
00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:28.800
Please don't kill us.

486
00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:30.300
Jihuai.

487
00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:31.650
How many are left?

488
00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:33.560
Your Highness.

489
00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:34.660
All that's left

490
00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:35.520
are these little thieves.

491
00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:39.080
What were the charges against them?

492
00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:41.560
Why hadn't they been executed?

493
00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:43.970
I can't remember exactly.

494
00:22:44.410 --> 00:22:45.970
With so many cases in Supreme Court,

495
00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:48.060
who knows what these two little thieves

496
00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:48.600
have done?

497
00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:50.300
I will see

498
00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:50.970
what the new cases are.

499
00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:52.410
Unsolvable cases

500
00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:54.100
will be blamed on

501
00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:54.900
the people of Jinpo.

502
00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:00.970
Antique shop burglary.

503
00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:02.560
Dozens of forgeries were stolen.

504
00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:05.040
Jinpo's people did it.

505
00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:10.360
Falling into a sty while stealing a pig.

506
00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:12.900
Chased by a dog for miles

507
00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:14.280
and the dog got lost and didn't go home.

508
00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:16.250
Jinpo's people did it.

509
00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:18.730
Robbing a woman.

510
00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:21.460
Found out it was a man

511
00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:22.620
and got beaten up.

512
00:23:23.690 --> 00:23:25.100
Jinpo's people did it.

513
00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:25.700
(Robbery of a woman)

514
00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:28.040
Jinpo.

515
00:23:28.930 --> 00:23:29.890
Jinpo.

516
00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:31.210
Jinpo.

517
00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:32.320
Jinpo.

518
00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:33.560
Jinpo.

519
00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:34.860
Don't you dare

520
00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:35.560
accuse our Jinpo!

521
00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:37.250
We are not that bad.

522
00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:38.340
- Don't you dare
- Don't you dare

523
00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:39.410
- accuse our Jinpo!
- accuse our Jinpo!

524
00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:42.520
Yours?

525
00:23:48.210 --> 00:23:48.930
Jihuai.

526
00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:50.080
Yes.

527
00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:50.890
Jot it down.

528
00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:52.080
These two have

529
00:23:52.170 --> 00:23:53.760
informed us of the secrets of Jinpo.

530
00:23:54.490 --> 00:23:56.010
Spread the word to Jinpo

531
00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:58.080
and see how Jinpo

532
00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:01.210
will treat their families.

533
00:24:12.730 --> 00:24:13.690
Your Highness.

534
00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:14.930
You've slayed it.

535
00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:16.730
All the ministers were silent.

536
00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:19.210
They're just a bunch of old codgers

537
00:24:19.410 --> 00:24:20.250
who are easy to deal with.

538
00:24:21.010 --> 00:24:22.170
Unlike Princess Hua.

539
00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:24.360
Are you

540
00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:25.980
trying to have a go

541
00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:26.660
at Princess Hua?

542
00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:28.970
If the Hua family isn't so powerful,

543
00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:30.460
why would I

544
00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:31.460
try so hard?

545
00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:33.600
I can just kill them.

546
00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:36.250
Well,

547
00:24:36.410 --> 00:24:37.560
you have wronged.

548
00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:38.730
You're right.

549
00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:41.010
I feel wronged extremely.

550
00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:43.120
However,

551
00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:46.800
I can still suffer from it.

552
00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:51.040
What do you mean?

553
00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:53.520
How about a heart-to-heart chat?

554
00:24:54.650 --> 00:24:55.980
Then you really

555
00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:57.060
have to suffer from it.

556
00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:04.450
(Minister Mansion)

557
00:25:04.450 --> 00:25:05.120
Jiamin.

558
00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:07.930
Jiamin?

559
00:25:14.970 --> 00:25:15.800
Ouch.

560
00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:17.410
Gently, mother.

561
00:25:17.410 --> 00:25:18.250
Look at you.

562
00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:19.730
(Account Book)
Spending money lavishly.

563
00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:20.650
What a disgrace.

564
00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:21.460
Can't you

565
00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:22.540
be like Hua Liuli?

566
00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:22.940
(Account Book)

567
00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:23.980
I heard that the dress

568
00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:24.900
she wore to the plum blossom banquet

569
00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:26.360
was made from our scraps.

570
00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:27.250
Mother.

571
00:25:27.410 --> 00:25:29.010
Can you stop mentioning Hua Liuli?

572
00:25:29.010 --> 00:25:30.760
I really hate her.

573
00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:33.120
What has she done to you?

574
00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:37.890
I was once the first noble
daughter of the capital.

575
00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:38.690
Everyone knows that

576
00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:40.170
I was to be betrothed
to the Prince.

577
00:25:40.450 --> 00:25:41.360
And now

578
00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:42.080
here she is,

579
00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:43.690
stealing all the limelight from me

580
00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:45.600
and His Majesty is
giving her a betrothal.

581
00:25:46.010 --> 00:25:47.120
Except for the Third Prince,

582
00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:48.320
the Crown Prince and Prince Ying

583
00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:49.320
are all around her.

584
00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:50.560
Of course I'm annoyed.

585
00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:51.600
Didn't you say you didn't want

586
00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:53.040
to marry a prince before?

587
00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:54.600
You were obsessed with

588
00:25:54.730 --> 00:25:55.970
Yun Han from Jinling Garden.

589
00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:57.280
Why did you change your mind?

590
00:25:57.450 --> 00:25:58.250
Idolising Yun Han

591
00:25:58.280 --> 00:25:59.450
is not the same as getting married.

592
00:26:00.410 --> 00:26:01.520
They were supposed to be mine

593
00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:02.840
and now they've all been taken away.

594
00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:04.010
I'm not happy.

595
00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:05.490
You're not happy.

596
00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:07.080
So you stay home all day?

597
00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:09.040
Learn from your mother.

598
00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:10.360
When I adored

599
00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:11.520
General Wei,

600
00:26:11.730 --> 00:26:12.800
I went

601
00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:13.600
wherever she went.

602
00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:15.250
She is not a man.

603
00:26:15.450 --> 00:26:16.600
If she were,

604
00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:18.170
she'd have been on my palms.

605
00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:19.970
Are you sure?

606
00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:20.970
Of course.

607
00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:21.890
Why else would General Wei

608
00:26:21.930 --> 00:26:22.930
have entrusted me with

609
00:26:22.930 --> 00:26:23.930
such an important task

610
00:26:23.930 --> 00:26:25.080
as a wrestling competition?

611
00:26:26.170 --> 00:26:27.360
Don't listen to
Consort Xian and the others

612
00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:28.450
about how close they are to her.

613
00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:29.450
In fact, General Wei's

614
00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:31.040
real best friend

615
00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:32.410
is me.

616
00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:33.930
So do you like Hua Liuli?

617
00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:35.280
Don't say yes.

618
00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:37.410
She is General Wei's daughter.

619
00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:39.080
Of course I like her.

620
00:26:39.490 --> 00:26:40.210
Fine.

621
00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:41.450
I don't like her.

622
00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:43.320
You are the best.

623
00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:45.600
I just want to tell you that

624
00:26:45.970 --> 00:26:48.170
you have to go for what you like.

625
00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:50.360
You must not lose.

626
00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:52.690
Leave.

627
00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:54.780
- Get out.
- Remember to tell Liuli

628
00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:56.340
to come over when she's free.

629
00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:57.540
Mother, get out.

630
00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:03.040
(Ten Rules of Noble Women)
Men are defined by their strength

631
00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:05.040
and women by their gentleness.

632
00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:07.170
A strong man is noble,

633
00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:09.930
a gentle woman is beautiful.

634
00:27:11.650 --> 00:27:13.320
If my mother had seen this,

635
00:27:13.690 --> 00:27:15.520
she would have burned it all down.

636
00:27:16.930 --> 00:27:18.170
Miss.

637
00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:19.650
Your priority right now

638
00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:20.600
should be His Highness

639
00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:21.450
who almost

640
00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:22.600
got knocked unconscious

641
00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:24.170
to protect you.

642
00:27:24.170 --> 00:27:24.890
Yes.

643
00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:26.690
Oh, no.

644
00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:28.520
He is the Crown Prince.

645
00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:30.280
How could you jump on him?

646
00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:31.650
Don't make a fuss.

647
00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:34.210
I am a delicate girl.

648
00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:35.120
Are you expecting me

649
00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:36.600
to protect him?

650
00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:38.600
He is the Crown Prince.

651
00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:39.840
Exactly.

652
00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:41.360
I want him to know

653
00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:43.410
how unlucky he is to meet me

654
00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:45.140
so he won't want to

655
00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:45.930
bother me all the time.

656
00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:50.120
However,

657
00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:53.890
I think

658
00:27:54.730 --> 00:27:56.170
I've discovered

659
00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:58.080
His Highness's weakness.

660
00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:11.740
(His Highness is)

661
00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:13.450
(a man who shows compassion for women.)

662
00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:16.490
Could it be...

663
00:28:16.690 --> 00:28:17.560
Your Highness.

664
00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:19.170
What brings you here?

665
00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:22.210
Miss.

666
00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:23.760
He really came today.

667
00:28:24.010 --> 00:28:24.970
It seems that the trick

668
00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:26.250
doesn't work on him.

669
00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:28.520
Oh, no.

670
00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:29.930
He must have come for revenge.

671
00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:31.490
I need to hide.

672
00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:42.210
Greetings, Your Highness.

673
00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:47.690
Your Highness.

674
00:28:47.890 --> 00:28:49.360
You are a true man.

675
00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:51.280
I'm really impressed with

676
00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:53.040
the speed of your recovery.

677
00:28:53.650 --> 00:28:54.250
Impressed.

678
00:28:57.730 --> 00:28:58.690
Your Highness.

679
00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:00.320
You

680
00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:02.690
look good today.

681
00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:09.490
Father thought

682
00:29:09.490 --> 00:29:11.080
I acted too abruptly the other day

683
00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:13.250
and asked me to come
and apologise to you.

684
00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:15.890
After deep reflection,

685
00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:17.690
I think father was right.

686
00:29:18.450 --> 00:29:19.360
So I've decided

687
00:29:19.690 --> 00:29:20.740
to take you to

688
00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:21.840
the most suitable place

689
00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:23.540
as compensation.

690
00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:28.780
Don't move.

691
00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:38.650
Your Highness.

692
00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:40.120
Your Highness.

693
00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:41.450
You can take it out on me.

694
00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:42.410
Don't hurt her.

695
00:29:42.410 --> 00:29:44.120
Miss, run.

696
00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:46.490
Princess Hua.

697
00:29:47.010 --> 00:29:47.760
Is your maidservant

698
00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:48.760
not in her right mind?

699
00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:57.450
It's crooked.

700
00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:18.450
Though Consort Xian

701
00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:19.930
had hosted a plum blossom banquet,

702
00:30:20.650 --> 00:30:21.760
I thought

703
00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:24.360
you might not have enjoyed it.

704
00:30:24.970 --> 00:30:25.690
So

705
00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:27.520
I...

706
00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:31.730
(I vomited a lot of blood)

707
00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:33.280
(and you still bring me here)

708
00:30:33.450 --> 00:30:34.320
(to recall it.)

709
00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:36.120
(Do you hate me so much?)

710
00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:41.250
(I really can't grasp his mind.)

711
00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:43.320
Princess Hua.

712
00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:44.490
I'd like to ask you.

713
00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:45.890
At the plum blossom banquet...

714
00:30:47.250 --> 00:30:47.650
Princess Hua.

715
00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:54.490
Thank you, Your Highness.

716
00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:57.930
(Gosh.)

717
00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:03.010
(He's starting to suspect me again.)

718
00:31:12.010 --> 00:31:13.410
(There you are.)

719
00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:15.800
(I mustn't talk foolishly today.)

720
00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:18.210
(Take a deep breath.)

721
00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:23.930
Prince Ying.

722
00:31:25.210 --> 00:31:26.210
What a coincidence.

723
00:31:26.410 --> 00:31:28.080
You are here, too.

724
00:31:31.650 --> 00:31:33.410
What brings you here?

725
00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:36.080
Prince Ying.

726
00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:37.490
Are you not happy to see me?

727
00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:40.040
Last time you said to my face

728
00:31:40.250 --> 00:31:41.450
that I was unattractive.

729
00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:43.080
Then why should I smile

730
00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:44.010
when I see you?

731
00:31:45.210 --> 00:31:46.010
No.

732
00:31:46.250 --> 00:31:47.170
Prince Ying.

733
00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:48.760
Actually, I was...

734
00:31:49.450 --> 00:31:50.280
Forget it.

735
00:31:51.450 --> 00:31:53.010
I've thought about it.

736
00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:56.210
If you don't think I look good,

737
00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:59.690
that means you don't have an aesthetic.

738
00:31:59.690 --> 00:32:00.730
You have bad taste.

739
00:32:02.170 --> 00:32:02.560
Yes.

740
00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:03.970
You are right.

741
00:32:04.490 --> 00:32:05.890
So let me

742
00:32:05.890 --> 00:32:07.250
take a good look at you

743
00:32:07.490 --> 00:32:08.280
to improve my aesthetic sense.

744
00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:14.170
I am generous.

745
00:32:14.490 --> 00:32:15.490
Of course I will

746
00:32:15.690 --> 00:32:16.520
give you a chance.

747
00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:17.890
Go ahead.

748
00:32:34.730 --> 00:32:35.360
Princess.

749
00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:39.080
Have you seen enough?

750
00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:44.280
I shall take my leave.

751
00:32:51.210 --> 00:32:51.890
Prince Ying

752
00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:53.250
is really as eye-catching

753
00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:54.320
as Yun Han.

754
00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:13.760
Your Highness.

755
00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:17.170
Did you ask me out today

756
00:33:17.890 --> 00:33:19.560
just to watch flowers?

757
00:33:25.930 --> 00:33:26.450
Why?

758
00:33:26.970 --> 00:33:27.970
Aren't they pretty?

759
00:33:29.170 --> 00:33:29.760
Master Pei.

760
00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:32.010
Do you think His Highness

761
00:33:32.250 --> 00:33:33.650
is having a heart-to-heart chat?

762
00:33:34.650 --> 00:33:36.040
What do you think he is doing?

763
00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:38.970
Pretty.

764
00:33:39.170 --> 00:33:39.730
Talking about flowers.

765
00:33:57.650 --> 00:33:59.450
Now this is a real deal.

766
00:33:59.690 --> 00:34:00.650
Let's go.

767
00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:07.690
(Looks like he's trying
to trick me again.)

768
00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:08.330
Princess Hua.

769
00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:10.290
The flowers are dazzling.

770
00:34:11.490 --> 00:34:12.290
Wipe your eyes.

771
00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:16.120
Thank you, Your Highness.

772
00:34:20.850 --> 00:34:22.010
(This handkerchief...)

773
00:34:25.330 --> 00:34:26.010
Princess Hua.

774
00:34:28.140 --> 00:34:29.100
Liuli.

775
00:34:29.850 --> 00:34:30.970
What do you see?

776
00:34:33.770 --> 00:34:35.240
Your Highness.

777
00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:37.560
Where did you

778
00:34:38.370 --> 00:34:39.890
find this handkerchief?

779
00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:53.660
In fact,

780
00:34:54.330 --> 00:34:55.820
I have many questions

781
00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:56.900
for you since then.

782
00:34:57.680 --> 00:34:58.810
Why does the blood on this handkerchief

783
00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:00.680
smell like fruit?

784
00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:02.770
I've always wanted to have

785
00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:03.930
a good chat with you.

786
00:35:04.810 --> 00:35:05.930
You don't have to

787
00:35:06.850 --> 00:35:07.930
be so secretive

788
00:35:08.330 --> 00:35:09.930
in front of me.

789
00:35:10.930 --> 00:35:11.740
(Do you think)

790
00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:13.080
(this will make me submit?)

791
00:35:13.330 --> 00:35:14.010
(You)

792
00:35:14.010 --> 00:35:15.220
(underestimate me.)

793
00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:15.810
Princess Hua.

794
00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:17.120
What do you think?

795
00:35:21.010 --> 00:35:22.080
Your Highness.

796
00:35:22.490 --> 00:35:23.600
I'm not going to lie,

797
00:35:24.330 --> 00:35:25.890
but this fruity fragrance

798
00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:27.600
is actually my body scent.

799
00:35:27.970 --> 00:35:29.680
If you don't believe me,

800
00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:32.330
you can smell it.

801
00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:34.240
No.

802
00:35:34.410 --> 00:35:35.810
What are you doing?

803
00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:37.810
I thought you didn't believe me.

804
00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:40.120
Then I shall let you

805
00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:41.520
smell the fruity scent.

806
00:35:42.930 --> 00:35:43.720
(Goodness.)

807
00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:45.560
(You usually act tough.)

808
00:35:45.770 --> 00:35:47.080
(Why are you blushing?)

809
00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:49.290
(No one will believe it.)

810
00:35:50.930 --> 00:35:52.370
It's getting late.

811
00:35:52.810 --> 00:35:54.120
I am a little tired.

812
00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:56.290
I'll take my leave.

813
00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:57.200
Princess Hua.

814
00:36:08.370 --> 00:36:09.100
(She...)

815
00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:10.490
(She's actually...)

816
00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:12.930
(He doesn't think I am)

817
00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:15.120
(doing it on purpose, does he?)

818
00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:16.370
What are you doing?

819
00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:39.010
Yuanhao.

820
00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:40.330
Why are you here again?

821
00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:41.240
You haven't even

822
00:36:41.410 --> 00:36:42.520
explained what you're doing

823
00:36:43.490 --> 00:36:44.970
and you're questioning me?

824
00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:46.930
Princess Hua.

825
00:36:47.290 --> 00:36:48.040
Do you still remember

826
00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:49.290
our engagement?

827
00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:53.450
I think

828
00:36:53.850 --> 00:36:55.890
there is such a thing.

829
00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:04.010
Even though she's not my wife now,

830
00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:05.890
she will be.

831
00:37:06.450 --> 00:37:07.770
Well,

832
00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:09.450
since that is the case,

833
00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:12.010
I think your doing

834
00:37:12.450 --> 00:37:14.200
is really inappropriate.

835
00:37:14.450 --> 00:37:16.850
(Although Prince Ying is goofy,)

836
00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:18.930
(he can help me out.)

837
00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:20.720
Prince Ying.

838
00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:22.600
I think you are right.

839
00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:24.560
His Majesty's order cannot be violated.

840
00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:27.240
Your Highness.

841
00:37:27.410 --> 00:37:28.680
It's not really appropriate for you

842
00:37:28.850 --> 00:37:29.970
to keep asking me out like this.

843
00:37:30.370 --> 00:37:31.120
I think

844
00:37:31.330 --> 00:37:32.810
we should keep some distance.

845
00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:37.160
I came to you

846
00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:38.850
to work on the case

847
00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:40.720
and to protect you.

848
00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:42.890
On the other hand,

849
00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:43.930
don't you think

850
00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:45.080
you've acted

851
00:37:45.410 --> 00:37:47.200
inappropriately as well?

852
00:37:50.370 --> 00:37:51.810
I'm told

853
00:37:52.010 --> 00:37:53.720
the case is now closed.

854
00:37:54.330 --> 00:37:55.240
So you don't need to

855
00:37:55.450 --> 00:37:56.640
waste any more time

856
00:37:56.850 --> 00:37:58.080
on me.

857
00:37:58.290 --> 00:37:59.370
As for my safety,

858
00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:01.560
Prince Ying will protect me, too.

859
00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:02.080
Of course.

860
00:38:02.890 --> 00:38:03.490
Jingua.

861
00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:03.930
Yes.

862
00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:04.560
Get the carriage.

863
00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:06.120
Yes.

864
00:38:06.850 --> 00:38:07.520
Princess Hua.

865
00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:08.720
Please.

866
00:38:08.890 --> 00:38:10.010
Thank you, Prince Ying.

867
00:38:16.850 --> 00:38:17.770
(I called you here)

868
00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:19.810
(to tell you that)

869
00:38:19.890 --> 00:38:21.450
(I have no intention of
making an enemy of you.)

870
00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:24.560
(Ankang Garden)
(How can I gain your trust?)

871
00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:25.940
(Ankang Garden)

872
00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:31.720
Your Highness.

873
00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:33.200
Your Highness.

874
00:38:35.010 --> 00:38:35.780
Guess what

875
00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:37.080
I've got for you today.

876
00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:39.080
Jiannan and Shaochun liquor.

877
00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:40.290
This liquor

878
00:38:40.450 --> 00:38:41.120
is rarely stocked

879
00:38:41.290 --> 00:38:42.240
in the liquor house.

880
00:38:42.490 --> 00:38:43.810
Get someone to fire up the stove.

881
00:38:44.010 --> 00:38:45.850
We shall sit around the stove
and heat the liquor

882
00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:46.810
- while watching the moon.
- Jihuai.

883
00:38:47.330 --> 00:38:48.820
Do you remember what you did

884
00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:49.780
last time you got drunk?

885
00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:54.160
From today,

886
00:38:54.970 --> 00:38:56.290
I refuse to drink around the stove.

887
00:38:57.120 --> 00:38:57.810
Here.

888
00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:07.770
She actually said that

889
00:39:07.970 --> 00:39:09.930
my eldest brother is better than me.

890
00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:12.200
What a joke.

891
00:39:12.450 --> 00:39:14.200
You were all groomed up.

892
00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:16.560
She is blind. Here.

893
00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:27.040
I was trying to clear up
any misunderstandings

894
00:39:27.370 --> 00:39:28.600
with her today,

895
00:39:28.890 --> 00:39:29.850
to make her less nervous

896
00:39:30.010 --> 00:39:30.810
in front of me

897
00:39:31.010 --> 00:39:32.890
and to be open with her,

898
00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:33.970
but...

899
00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:35.970
It was too much for her.

900
00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:37.160
This is unacceptable!

901
00:39:38.010 --> 00:39:38.560
Drink.

902
00:39:38.810 --> 00:39:39.330
Drink.

903
00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:44.200
So, Your highness,

904
00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:45.850
what did you do?

905
00:39:46.370 --> 00:39:47.970
I just gave her back

906
00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:49.040
the handkerchief that

907
00:39:49.290 --> 00:39:50.370
she spat blood on before.

908
00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:52.450
I even gave her back the evidence.

909
00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:54.160
I was sincere.

910
00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:55.930
Exactly.

911
00:39:56.450 --> 00:39:57.120
She didn't appreciate it.

912
00:39:57.330 --> 00:39:58.520
It was her problem.

913
00:39:58.720 --> 00:39:59.810
Exactly.

914
00:40:12.010 --> 00:40:12.720
Su.

915
00:40:15.450 --> 00:40:16.330
Listen.

916
00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:20.370
Let me share with you

917
00:40:21.850 --> 00:40:23.490
a very good saying.

918
00:40:25.890 --> 00:40:29.370
"Let go of your reservations

919
00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:32.370
to achieve the desired result."

920
00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:32.890
No way.

921
00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:40.770
Will it work?

922
00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:41.520
Yes.

923
00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:45.500
(Pretentious Hour)

924
00:40:47.810 --> 00:40:49.810
What a beautiful view.

925
00:40:50.370 --> 00:40:53.890
A plum blossom blooms in the cold,
like a strip of white jade,

926
00:40:54.290 --> 00:40:56.970
away from the village road and
close to the bridge over the stream.

927
00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:00.720
I didn't know it was the plum blossoms.

928
00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:04.080
I thought it was the snow
that hadn't melted.

929
00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:06.640
Prince Ying.

930
00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:08.490
You are so eloquent.

931
00:41:09.290 --> 00:41:10.720
In fact, this is

932
00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:11.850
what my mother

933
00:41:11.970 --> 00:41:13.330
told me to do.

934
00:41:13.450 --> 00:41:14.810
I just randomly recited it.

935
00:41:14.850 --> 00:41:15.680
You didn't understand anyway.

936
00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:16.520
Say it again.

937
00:41:17.810 --> 00:41:18.890
My mother was right.

938
00:41:18.930 --> 00:41:19.780
You are hopeless.

939
00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:20.770
I'll take my leave.

940
00:41:22.410 --> 00:41:23.040
