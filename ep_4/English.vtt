=Episode 4=

17
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.290
Princess Hua is odd

18
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.770
and arrogant.

19
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.050
I think

20
00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.320
she's been taught by Hua family

21
00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.600
so she's holding grudges.

22
00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.600
Hua Liuli, how dare you!

23
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.490
Lin Huizhi

24
00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.490
might have been exiled,

25
00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.130
but he was

26
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.290
an imperial officer.

27
00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:02.520
Hua Liuli,

28
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.720
you're arrogant,

29
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.650
aren't you?

30
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.960
I dare not

31
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.160
think about this.

32
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.010
Official Lin Huizhi

33
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.320
must have suffered a lot.

34
00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.250
Princess Hua's behaviour

35
00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.810
is too much.

36
00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.600
Read on.

37
00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.040
Who would have thought

38
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.690
that when I was about to set off,

39
00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.920
I found that the courtyard

40
00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.200
was full of dead chickens.

41
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.850
Bill, please.

42
00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:28.410
Okay.

43
00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.880
Bill, please.

44
00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.480
Thank you, sir.

45
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:30.130
Thank you, sir.

46
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.410
Thank you.

47
00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.920
All right.

48
00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.010
Please take care, sir.

49
00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:39.320
They're dead.

50
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:41.040
Miss.

51
00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:42.570
Thank you for saving my life.

52
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.090
Thank you.

53
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.130
I don't understand what you're saying.

54
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.250
Anyway, I won't give you meat.

55
00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.570
How could food for a prisoners

56
00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:52.440
so sumptuous?

57
00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:53.290
There's even meat.

58
00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:54.720
There must be something
suspicious about this.

59
00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:55.880
Gentlemen,

60
00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.530
please pay attention

61
00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:58.530
to this official's food

62
00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:59.850
on the way of escorting him.

63
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.810
So,

64
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.970
Princess Hua did everything

65
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.600
to protect me.

66
00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.880
I think her arrogance,

67
00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.530
pickiness and affectation

68
00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.920
was also to avoid alerting the enemy.

69
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.200
Princess Hua is very
discerning and wise.

70
00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.130
She saved a life.

71
00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.880
She even considered

72
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.760
my safety after that.

73
00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.570
It can be said that
she's righteous and wise.

74
00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.370
I am far inferior to her.

75
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.440
Lin Huizhi is old and stubborn.

76
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.320
Princess Hua is far lovelier.

77
00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:31.440
Please rise.

78
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:33.370
Thank you, Your Majesty.

79
00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.200
Father, I have something
to report to you.

80
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:38.130
Speak.

81
00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.760
Princess Hua

82
00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.320
is a delicate and kind woman.

83
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.040
However, I have heard that
someone has been deliberately

84
00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.290
causing her trouble since she
arrived in the capital recently.

85
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.320
Father, I hope that
you can issue an decree

86
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.760
to take good care of her.

87
00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:54.410
I think that

88
00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:55.640
no matter who it is,

89
00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.600
he or she should not
target Princess Hua.

90
00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.880
If there's any issue, they
should turn to the Hua family.

91
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:01.920
They are the source

92
00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.010
of all these problems.

93
00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.200
The Hua family stations
troops on the border,

94
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.440
causing harm to the people
and wasting resources.

95
00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.920
We are going to
negotiate with Jinpo now.

96
00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.200
Why not disband the army

97
00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.040
and bring peace to the world?

98
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.200
This will also demonstrate
the sincerity of our kingdom

99
00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:16.760
in the negotiations.

100
00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:19.130
Yes, that's right.

101
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.440
(How will you solve this?)

102
00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.050
Grand Preceptor has
been silent all this time.

103
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.930
I wonder what your thoughts are.

104
00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.840
Your Majesty, I think

105
00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.840
Prince Ying's suggestion makes sense.

106
00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:39.050
The country is at peace now.

107
00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.960
(As the leaders of civil officials,)

108
00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.490
(Grand Preceptor is
not easy to deal with.)

109
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:43.810
We should bide our time
and act accordingly.

110
00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:45.760
If we continue to raise

111
00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.690
military funds and supplies as before,

112
00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.440
it will be a huge drain

113
00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:50.690
on the treasury.

114
00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:51.960
This will not benefit the imperial court

115
00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.280
nor the future peace talks.

116
00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.730
Prince Ying's proposal

117
00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.170
is indeed a viable solution.

118
00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.250
(I must take action now.)

119
00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:10.010
Your Majesty,

120
00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.570
as a woman, I don't understand much,

121
00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.810
but before

122
00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:16.200
coming here,

123
00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.200
my father instructed me

124
00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.130
to bring two gifts to you, Your Majesty.

125
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.960
Your Majesty, could you allow me

126
00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.320
to present the gifts first?

127
00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:24.280
Of course.

128
00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:26.200
Thank you, Your Majesty.

129
00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:29.320
However, the gifts I brought

130
00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:30.400
are somewhat large.

131
00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.280
I'm afraid it's not convenient
to present them at the hall.

132
00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.640
Your Majesty, may I suggest

133
00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:38.200
us, along with the officials,
to move outside?

134
00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.640
San Cai,

135
00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.640
help me check it.

136
00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:44.170
Yes, Your Majesty.

137
00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.080
Thank you, Your Majesty.

138
00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.050
(It's just pancake.)

139
00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.200
(Why can't they be moved into the palace?)

140
00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:01.320
Your Majesty.

141
00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:04.200
Your Majesty.

142
00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:07.960
What are the gifts?

143
00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:12.130
Your Majesty.

144
00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:13.930
Princess Hua has displayed

145
00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.640
the battle of Qingya Town,

146
00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:16.760
where Hua Army

147
00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.880
and Jinpo's army clashed.

148
00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.490
Bring me there to have a look.

149
00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:27.280
Prince Ying and Princess Hua

150
00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.570
are competing on this sand table.

151
00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:30.810
This is a little gadget

152
00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:31.810
from our border.

153
00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:34.010
My father often uses this
to practise military tactics.

154
00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:35.490
I wonder which official

155
00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:36.810
would be willing to give me some advice.

156
00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:38.370
I'll go.

157
00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:45.960
I'll send a unit

158
00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:47.200
to attack directly through the centre,

159
00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:48.520
while flanking from both sides.

160
00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:49.730
Surround them!

161
00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.490
What does this mean?

162
00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:58.130
Your Highness,

163
00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.610
you are well-read.

164
00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:00.810
Don't you understand flag language?

165
00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:04.570
Of course, I understand what it means.

166
00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:14.400
This...

167
00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:17.440
Your Highness,

168
00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.760
do you really know flag language?

169
00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:23.280
Why did you command
to abandon the city and flee?

170
00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:24.540
(Order)

171
00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:25.730
No.

172
00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:28.880
I wanted to send a unit.

173
00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:30.250
My troops

174
00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:31.400
have surrounded you.

175
00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:33.440
Victory is imminent.

176
00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.840
How do you know it's all of them?

177
00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:52.690
I lost.

178
00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:55.440
Your Highness,

179
00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:57.200
this wasn't a real battle.

180
00:07:57.490 --> 00:07:58.960
Don't take it to heart.

181
00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:00.730
You're mistaken.

182
00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:02.400
If it was a real battle,

183
00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:03.810
I would never lose.

184
00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.170
Your Highness,

185
00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:06.960
the battlefield is no child's play.

186
00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:08.610
Are you saying

187
00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:10.130
that you think you can be

188
00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:11.440
the leader of an army?

189
00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:13.810
Princess Hua,

190
00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:15.960
the Hua family holds considerable power

191
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:17.640
and they're appointing
a civilian to lead.

192
00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:19.960
This is simply the trend of the times.

193
00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:21.640
Your Highness, do you mean

194
00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:23.570
there's no talented military officer?

195
00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:25.520
During this era of peace,

196
00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:27.400
whay do we need these military officers?

197
00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:28.520
What did you say?

198
00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:29.440
Without us,

199
00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:30.610
could you have enjoyed
this era of peace?

200
00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:32.970
Do you hear what he's saying?

201
00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:35.330
(She's trying to drive
a wedge between us.)

202
00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:51.970
Come on, all of you!

203
00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:01.970
Don't come any closer!

204
00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:09.210
This...

205
00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:11.280
You're Crown Prince.

206
00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:11.880
How could you allow them

207
00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:13.040
to behave like this?

208
00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:14.610
Tell them to stop.

209
00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:17.330
Stop!

210
00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:19.400
Nobody can move!

211
00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:21.280
Do you still respect His Majesty?

212
00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:24.640
Father, I think

213
00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:25.490
the officials

214
00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:27.010
are complaining about
each other every day.

215
00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:28.490
They secretly hold grudges
against each other.

216
00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.760
It's a way to balance work and leisure.

217
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:32.920
This...

218
00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.160
Father, I think

219
00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:36.730
this is the first time in history

220
00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:38.680
that we have such a situation.

221
00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:40.450
We really should

222
00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:41.800
thank Princess Hua.

223
00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:03.800
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

224
00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:06.040
I am thinking of the countless soldiers

225
00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:07.490
who guard our country.

226
00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:09.370
I acted impulsively.

227
00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:12.130
It has been many years since

228
00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:13.850
I have personally gone to a battlefield.

229
00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:16.040
Even back then,

230
00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:18.370
I would never have

231
00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:20.400
made an arrogant claim

232
00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.490
to replace Protector General.

233
00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:28.610
Your Majesty,

234
00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:32.090
do you remember
the battle of Qingya Town?

235
00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:33.520
Of course I remember.

236
00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:35.800
It was the most brutal battle

237
00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:38.370
where our soldiers won
against greater odds.

238
00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:39.730
I have something else

239
00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:41.040
to present to you, Your Majesty.

240
00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:00.970
In that battle,

241
00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:03.090
although we killed tens of thousands
of the soldiers of our enemy,

242
00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.280
in the end, only a few
thousands of us remained.

243
00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:08.330
At that time, those soldiers
who remained in the city

244
00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:09.560
defended it to the death.

245
00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:11.760
They even signed
a life-and-death agreement.

246
00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:14.040
This included Protector General.

247
00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:18.250
They only had one thought at that time,

248
00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.130
which was to defend Qingya Town.

249
00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:21.880
If the town fell,

250
00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:23.880
the State Of Jin would be in danger.

251
00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:25.880
Finally, the soldiers

252
00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:27.130
fell down one by one,

253
00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:28.610
but no one

254
00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:29.730
retreated.

255
00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:35.330
Guys, charge!

256
00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:38.640
They lived not for themselves.

257
00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:41.610
Nor did they die for themselves.

258
00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:43.370
Gentlemen,

259
00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:45.210
you only see

260
00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:46.640
Hua family troops at the border,

261
00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:48.370
but no one sees

262
00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:50.330
the soldiers of the State Of Jin
shedding blood on the battlefield.

263
00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:52.850
They fought for their parents,

264
00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:54.280
their children

265
00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:55.450
and above all, the State Of Jin's

266
00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:56.800
peace and prosperity.

267
00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:14.330
Father,

268
00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:16.450
I'll be back soon.

269
00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:23.040
Princess Hua.

270
00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:25.680
Your Highness,

271
00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:27.800
is there anything you need?

272
00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:28.880
It's not about

273
00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:29.850
the war situation.

274
00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:32.130
Princess Hua, haven't you been

275
00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:33.090
frail all this time?

276
00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:34.210
(I was careless.)

277
00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:40.250
I was just too excited.

278
00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:43.210
I suddenly feel so dizzy.

279
00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:44.560
(I'll use my old trick to save myself.)

280
00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:48.330
What's wrong?

281
00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:49.970
Your Highness, my medicine.

282
00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:53.560
Hurry.

283
00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:01.330
Being too outstanding

284
00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:03.280
may not necessarily be a good thing.

285
00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:05.330
Princess Hua.

286
00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:06.640
Let me ask you.

287
00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:08.370
How old are you?

288
00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:09.800
Your Majesty,

289
00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.090
I just turned 18 years old.

290
00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:14.850
Then it's time

291
00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:16.730
for you to get married.

292
00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:19.040
Do you have any man you like?

293
00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:21.040
I don't, Your Majesty.

294
00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:22.560
Besides,

295
00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:27.490
my health is not good.

296
00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:29.760
How can I involve others in my problems?

297
00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:34.130
With the way you performed
the military demonstration,

298
00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:35.010
you're worthy

299
00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:38.130
of the finest man

300
00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:39.450
in our country.

301
00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:41.370
Let me

302
00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:43.730
select a suitable candidate for you.

303
00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:45.330
I will definitely get you

304
00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:46.610
a husband that satisfies you.

305
00:13:58.280 --> 00:13:58.920
San Cai.

306
00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:00.520
Your Majesty.

307
00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:02.560
Summon Consort Xian to see me later.

308
00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:04.210
Yes, Your Majesty.

309
00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:05.730
(Consort Xian?)

310
00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:06.880
(Could it be that...)

311
00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:10.090
The court is dismissed.

312
00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:20.400
Gentlemen.

313
00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:22.760
Did you guys notice?

314
00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:25.010
His Majesty is really applying pressure.

315
00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:27.330
Consort Xian is Prince Ying's mother.

316
00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:28.640
Does His Majesty

317
00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.640
really want to betroth

318
00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:32.090
Princess Hua to Prince Ying?

319
00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:34.370
Is it possible that...

320
00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:35.920
No, there is no possibility.

321
00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:37.490
His Majesty is playing the matchmaker

322
00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:38.850
to make Prince Ying

323
00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:40.160
control Princess Hua.

324
00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:42.130
Since ancient times,

325
00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:43.920
marriage has been about balance.

326
00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:45.880
I think among these princes,

327
00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:48.330
only Prince Ying is the most suitable.

328
00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:51.040
If my father wants to choose

329
00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:53.330
the most outstanding man
for Princess Hua,

330
00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:56.210
who else

331
00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.040
is more suitable than me?

332
00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:03.160
What?

333
00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:05.520
His Majesty wants Yuanhao
to marry Hua Liuli?

334
00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:06.880
How can that happen?

335
00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:10.280
Consort Xian.

336
00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:11.490
(Consort Lin)
Please calm down.

337
00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:14.330
His Majesty has always
favoured Prince Ying.

338
00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:15.880
This idea

339
00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:18.010
must have been well thought out.

340
00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:19.130
Perhaps you can talk

341
00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:21.250
to His Majesty about it,

342
00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:23.130
in case this plan is feasible.

343
00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:23.760
Consort Lin,

344
00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:26.210
this matter does not concern you.

345
00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:28.250
If the third prince were to marry her,

346
00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:29.610
would you be willing?

347
00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:31.160
Would you not be anxious?

348
00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:34.330
I spoke out of turn.

349
00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:37.730
I think

350
00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:39.160
the Hua family is not

351
00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:40.130
as bad as you think.

352
00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:48.920
I will make a move first.

353
00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:56.730
(Everyone in the State Of Jin knows)

354
00:15:56.850 --> 00:15:58.400
(His Majesty wants to
deal with the Hua family.)

355
00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:01.330
(If Yuanhao marries Hua Liuli,)

356
00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:02.970
(he will certainly be implicated.)

357
00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:04.450
(This will ruin)

358
00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:06.450
(his chances of ascending the throne.)

359
00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:07.760
(It's surely)

360
00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:09.680
(Ji Yuansu's idea.)

361
00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:12.610
Where is Crown Prince?

362
00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:13.450
Consort Xian.

363
00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:14.730
I heard that

364
00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:15.370
His Highness

365
00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:16.640
is currently in the study.

366
00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:18.800
It is indeed him.

367
00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:33.040
Yuansu,

368
00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:35.560
why haven't you left?

369
00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:38.250
I want to keep you company, father.

370
00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:39.370
Besides,

371
00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:41.040
the snacks here are delicious.

372
00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:42.850
I want to eat more before leaving.

373
00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:47.210
Consort Xian has arrived.

374
00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:56.250
Greetings, Your Majesty.

375
00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:57.010
No need for formalities.

376
00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:07.650
Father,

377
00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:09.760
I will eat cake over there.

378
00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:12.520
I won't disturb you. Keep talking.

379
00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:17.410
Your Majesty,

380
00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:19.930
did you summon me
for a particular reason?

381
00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:23.730
I summoned you here to
discuss Yuanhao's matter.

382
00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:26.170
Yuanhao

383
00:17:27.010 --> 00:17:28.690
is of an marriageable age.

384
00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:31.650
I think he is skilled in martial arts

385
00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:34.280
and he enjoys the art
of military strategy.

386
00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:35.890
How about getting him

387
00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:38.040
a like-minded consort?

388
00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:41.280
Your Majesty, what do you mean?

389
00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:43.730
Protector General has a daughter

390
00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:46.210
who is pretty. She is 18 years old.

391
00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:47.170
Just right.

392
00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:49.360
If you have no objection,

393
00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:51.360
I will

394
00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:52.800
propose this marriage to Yingting.

395
00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:03.320
These preserved plums
are too sour for my teeth.

396
00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:06.930
Excuse me, I'll leave you to talk.

397
00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:09.970
Your Majesty, I just think that

398
00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:11.410
Yuanhao has a rather strong personality.

399
00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:13.600
If he marries a general's daughter,

400
00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:17.320
I'm afraid there will be
trouble in the future.

401
00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:18.560
Why don't you choose

402
00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:20.690
a gentle woman who is both

403
00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:22.170
knowledgeable and courteous for him?

404
00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:23.120
This way,

405
00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:25.560
the couple will live in harmony
and their life will be perfect.

406
00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:26.690
You did not

407
00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:27.690
meet this lady today.

408
00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:29.840
She is indeed knowledgeable
and courteous,

409
00:18:30.010 --> 00:18:31.010
She has a gentle personality.

410
00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:32.320
Also, she's gentle and weak.

411
00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:33.080
Your Majesty.

412
00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:36.170
Yuanhao is still a child.

413
00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:37.600
I just want

414
00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:39.450
to keep him by my side
for a few more years.

415
00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:42.970
He's only 26 years old.
Is he still young?

416
00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:44.040
That's right, father.

417
00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:46.040
Although Brother Yuanhao

418
00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:47.210
is already 26 years old,

419
00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:48.600
in the eyes of Consort Xian,

420
00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:49.840
he will

421
00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:52.280
always be a child.

422
00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:54.040
Indeed, he can't live
without his mother.

423
00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:57.280
Why don't we just forget it?

424
00:18:58.890 --> 00:18:59.890
All right.

425
00:19:00.970 --> 00:19:01.760
You can go back first.

426
00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:04.010
I'll think about it.

427
00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:05.760
I may leave now.

428
00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:12.250
(I have many sons,)

429
00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:13.600
(but I only have)

430
00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:16.410
(one trusted general, Hua Yingting.)

431
00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:22.690
It's bad, Miss.

432
00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:24.690
I think His Majesty wants
you to get married.

433
00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:26.080
What do we do now?

434
00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:28.970
Nowadays, our family is at the border

435
00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:31.010
and the Hua family's situation

436
00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:33.410
looks bright,

437
00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:35.800
but many people are watching us.

438
00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:37.650
Who knows

439
00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:38.970
when it will collapse?

440
00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:40.600
I don't have the energy

441
00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:42.320
to think about marriage.

442
00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:45.730
Besides, Prince Ying

443
00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:47.010
is not very smart

444
00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:49.760
nor good-looking.

445
00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:51.600
However, we cannot
defy His Majesty's order.

446
00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:52.970
We need to think of another plan.

447
00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:55.170
In terms of looks,

448
00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:57.210
Crown Prince is better-looking.

449
00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:00.800
However, Crown Prince

450
00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:02.210
is a bit scary.

451
00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:16.730
(He's literally come
knocking at our door!)

452
00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:24.040
Miss!

453
00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:26.490
Something terrible has happened.

454
00:20:26.650 --> 00:20:28.730
Princess Hua was scared
by a horse and she fainted.

455
00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:37.210
Miss.

456
00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:39.040
Who is she?

457
00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:39.890
She

458
00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:41.490
is the only daughter
of Protector General,

459
00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:43.250
Princess Hua Liuli!

460
00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:44.280
The daughter of General Hua!

461
00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:45.800
She fainted after
being scared by a horse.

462
00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:47.520
Father.

463
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:49.360
Why do you want to arrange a marriage

464
00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:50.890
between Hua Liuli and Yuanhao?

465
00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:52.800
Do you want to marry her instead?

466
00:20:56.690 --> 00:20:57.450
Yuanhao

467
00:20:57.560 --> 00:20:59.080
is a well-behaved and honest child.

468
00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:01.450
He can protect Princess Hua.

469
00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:03.450
Haven't you seen

470
00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:05.210
how he protected her
in the imperial court?

471
00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:06.650
During the chess game,

472
00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:08.490
he let her win.

473
00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:09.490
Your Majesty.

474
00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:11.040
What's the matter?

475
00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:12.730
There's news that

476
00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:14.760
Princess Hua was frightened
by Prince Ying's horse

477
00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:17.930
while she was on the road.

478
00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:18.520
What?

479
00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:21.120
Father.

480
00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:22.930
Princess Hua is frail and sickly

481
00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:24.010
and there aren't many

482
00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:25.520
good physicians in Qinghan Prefecture.

483
00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:27.320
Why don't I bring the imperial physician

484
00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:28.650
to examine her?

485
00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:29.730
That will be good.

486
00:21:30.410 --> 00:21:32.320
I can't let Hua Yingting's daughter

487
00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:33.730
have any accident as soon
as she arrives in the capital.

488
00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:34.730
Hurry up.

489
00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:36.760
Yes, father.

490
00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:41.490
I'm so angry.

491
00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:43.010
He rode his horse wildly on the street

492
00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:45.010
and blamed me for it.

493
00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:46.450
He really has a problem with his brain.

494
00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:48.250
Miss, don't be angry.

495
00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:49.210
Have a candy.

496
00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:51.280
Won't you open it for me?

497
00:21:53.010 --> 00:21:54.930
Miss, you know what?

498
00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:57.320
I think you're mad

499
00:21:57.560 --> 00:21:58.930
that he doesn't pay you any attention.

500
00:21:58.970 --> 00:21:59.890
Of course.

501
00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:01.520
I am a delicate young lady,

502
00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:02.560
yet he doesn't even care about me.

503
00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:03.010
He...

504
00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:08.120
Why is this candy so sticky?

505
00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:21.760
Yuan Wei, go to the street now.

506
00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:22.890
Find

507
00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:24.360
the most influential person,

508
00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:26.280
tell everyone exactly

509
00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:28.760
happened today

510
00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:30.520
and make it clear.

511
00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:37.120
Look, this chicken

512
00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:38.040
laid a duck egg.

513
00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:39.840
Chicken and duck, right?

514
00:22:42.650 --> 00:22:43.560
That's hilarious.

515
00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:48.080
Sir and madam,

516
00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:49.170
I want to ask you.

517
00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:50.450
How do I get to the pharmacy?

518
00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:53.840
Aren't you the servant
of the Hua family?

519
00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:55.730
Why are you asking about the pharmacy?

520
00:22:57.450 --> 00:22:58.730
Well,

521
00:22:58.890 --> 00:22:59.840
Princess Hua

522
00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:01.360
doesn't want it to be known publicly.

523
00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:04.010
So, how can I explain it to you?

524
00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:05.690
Of course, I won't
say it to anyone else.

525
00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:07.010
Can you tell me?

526
00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:10.250
You have no idea?

527
00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:12.690
Our princess was scared and she fainted.

528
00:23:13.730 --> 00:23:15.120
Today, she met Prince Ying
on Zhuque Street.

529
00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:17.040
He was galloping on his horse.

530
00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:17.800
Then...

531
00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:21.210
Your Highness.

532
00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:26.760
It's Princess Hua. What a coincidence.

533
00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:29.080
How did Princess Hua faint?

534
00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:30.970
My horse

535
00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:32.840
has never disturbed anyone before.

536
00:23:34.650 --> 00:23:35.490
It's him.

537
00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:36.360
Yes.

538
00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:37.760
He still won't admit it.

539
00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:39.520
He still says these things.

540
00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:43.410
Your Highness, Princess Hua has fainted.

541
00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:47.010
Princess Hua is too weak.

542
00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:49.490
She should stay home and rest well.

543
00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:50.490
She shouldn't go out.

544
00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:52.840
Why is she dressed so lightly?

545
00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:55.730
She's so delicate.

546
00:23:56.930 --> 00:23:58.560
How can she marry

547
00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:00.600
this country's most outstanding prince?

548
00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:07.450
Princess Hua.

549
00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:09.250
Don't worry.

550
00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:11.520
Even though you are not
a perfect match for me,

551
00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:14.320
if my father insists,

552
00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:16.280
I don't mind.

553
00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:19.250
Miss.

554
00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:23.930
Your Highness, do you think

555
00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:27.170
I frightened your horse instead?

556
00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:28.690
It doesn't matter.

557
00:24:30.450 --> 00:24:32.840
I am very sorry for this.

558
00:24:33.250 --> 00:24:34.320
It's all right.

559
00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:35.930
I don't mind.

560
00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:37.690
Princess Hua.

561
00:24:37.890 --> 00:24:39.760
If you have nothing else,

562
00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:41.730
I'll make a move first.

563
00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:42.360
Farewell.

564
00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:51.970
I am really angry.

565
00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:56.040
How could this happen?

566
00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:57.760
I did hear about it,

567
00:24:58.040 --> 00:24:58.970
but someone told us

568
00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:00.120
not to spread it.

569
00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:01.010
Right.

570
00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:02.930
Prince Ying

571
00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:04.280
rides his horse every day

572
00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:07.210
and everyone dares not speak up.

573
00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:08.010
He actually...

574
00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:10.730
He even knocked Princess Hua out.

575
00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:13.120
She had a fright and fainted.

576
00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:14.080
It's more or less the same.

577
00:25:14.730 --> 00:25:15.560
Are you getting medicine

578
00:25:15.730 --> 00:25:16.410
for Princess Hua?

579
00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:19.210
The pharmacy is over there.

580
00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:20.320
Hurry up

581
00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:22.410
or Princess Hua's
condition might worsen.

582
00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:23.360
All right,

583
00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:24.170
but

584
00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:25.760
please don't tell anyone
about this, all right?

585
00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:27.650
Sure.

586
00:25:31.890 --> 00:25:33.450
Prince Ying was riding his horse

587
00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:35.170
and he hit the daughter of General Hua.

588
00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:36.970
She fainted.

589
00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:38.800
It was really scary. She almost died.

590
00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:40.250
- Really?
- It's so scary.

591
00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:41.280
I can hardly take it.

592
00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:42.010
It's so serious.

593
00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:56.100
(Huichun Hall)

594
00:25:56.170 --> 00:25:57.450
I knew.

595
00:25:57.930 --> 00:25:58.800
Do you know about this?

596
00:25:58.800 --> 00:25:59.560
What's going on?

597
00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:01.250
Prince Ying is not satisfied

598
00:26:01.450 --> 00:26:02.730
that His Majesty arranged a marriage

599
00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:04.010
between him and Princess Hua.

600
00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:05.970
He intentionally hit her

601
00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:07.320
while riding his horse this morning.

602
00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:08.690
Given her small size

603
00:26:09.250 --> 00:26:10.320
and weak physique,

604
00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:11.520
she was flung

605
00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:12.930
to a great distance away.

606
00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:14.560
A great distance away!

607
00:26:15.490 --> 00:26:16.930
This is not an exaggeration.

608
00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:18.730
It's like pouring fuel on the fire.

609
00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:19.800
She spun five times before landing.

610
00:26:20.010 --> 00:26:20.730
Move aside!

611
00:26:21.010 --> 00:26:22.210
Crown Prince brought
the imperial physician

612
00:26:22.210 --> 00:26:22.760
to treat Princess Hua.

613
00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:24.520
Why is Crown Prince involved, too?

614
00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:26.520
She hasn't woken up yet.

615
00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:28.220
(Zhuge Liang's Military Tactics)

616
00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:38.320
Your Highness.

617
00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:39.730
Princess Hua is still resting.

618
00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:41.010
She hasn't woken up yet. Please...

619
00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:41.760
Move over.

620
00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:43.040
Please wait in the front hall.

621
00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:43.760
Your Highness.

622
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:45.410
You really can't come in now.

623
00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:56.450
Go away.

624
00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:05.800
(Sure enough, those assassins)

625
00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:07.760
(were all caught by this formation.)

626
00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:11.650
(It's quite interesting.)

627
00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:14.930
Finally, I understand the purpose

628
00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:17.040
of this young lady leaving this thing.

629
00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:20.040
Your Highness, what do you mean?

630
00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:21.210
Princess Hua has set up
several formations

631
00:27:21.410 --> 00:27:22.280
in this courtyard.

632
00:27:24.170 --> 00:27:25.010
Follow me

633
00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:26.250
or you won't be able to get in.

634
00:27:27.650 --> 00:27:28.730
Is this a formation?

635
00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:31.930
Your Highness.

636
00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:32.930
You really can't...

637
00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:34.170
Your Highness.

638
00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:41.210
Inform the princess

639
00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:42.730
that I'm here to see her.

640
00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:49.120
Miss.

641
00:27:50.170 --> 00:27:50.890
Miss.

642
00:27:55.450 --> 00:27:56.280
Princess Hua.

643
00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:04.930
Your Highness, why are you here?

644
00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:10.450
Please forgive me for my frail body.

645
00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:11.560
I cannot greet you.

646
00:28:12.210 --> 00:28:13.690
I know you are frail.

647
00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:14.560
That's why

648
00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:16.520
I specifically invited
an imperial physician

649
00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:17.320
to come and see you.

650
00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:19.520
You're frightened

651
00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:20.170
by my elder brother's horse.

652
00:28:21.650 --> 00:28:22.890
Come on, take a look.

653
00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:23.600
Your Highness.

654
00:28:23.890 --> 00:28:25.360
I have already obtained medicine

655
00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:27.120
for Princess Hua. She
only needs to rest.

656
00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:29.410
There's no need to trouble
the imperial physician.

657
00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:30.490
You must.

658
00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:32.120
I just heard it.

659
00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:33.490
Princess Hua's voice has changed.

660
00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:35.170
I must ensure that she is all right.

661
00:28:38.650 --> 00:28:39.250
Imperial physician.

662
00:28:40.450 --> 00:28:41.450
Your Highness.

663
00:28:43.010 --> 00:28:43.890
Yuan Wei.

664
00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:46.410
You must not be
disrespectful to His Highness.

665
00:28:46.930 --> 00:28:48.280
Let the imperial physician take a look.

666
00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:56.120
Please let me read your pulse.

667
00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:57.690
Just stretch out your hand.

668
00:29:03.250 --> 00:29:04.560
(Control the meridians.)

669
00:29:05.170 --> 00:29:07.120
(Force the blood and
qi to stop flowing.)

670
00:29:12.010 --> 00:29:13.600
Today, you were frightened by a horse.

671
00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:15.250
Did you feel anything else?

672
00:29:15.410 --> 00:29:18.650
I just feel a bit of pain in my throat.

673
00:29:21.410 --> 00:29:22.170
Yuan Wei.

674
00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:24.890
Answer for me.

675
00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:27.760
Princess Hua

676
00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:29.040
has had this problem since childhood.

677
00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:31.690
This fainting is also
a chronic condition.

678
00:29:31.890 --> 00:29:32.930
It is a chain reaction that
has been left untreated.

679
00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:36.210
No wonder.

680
00:29:36.410 --> 00:29:38.120
The pulse is so strange.

681
00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:41.970
Princess Hua is suffering
from blood deficiency.

682
00:29:42.170 --> 00:29:43.210
The vital energy is greatly depleted.

683
00:29:43.690 --> 00:29:44.730
Fainting easily

684
00:29:44.930 --> 00:29:45.930
is highly possible.

685
00:29:46.170 --> 00:29:47.520
She requires quiet recuperation

686
00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:49.840
and to be supplemented with medicine.

687
00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:00.210
The courtyard has formations.

688
00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:02.080
The library has military books.

689
00:30:03.410 --> 00:30:04.930
(The assassin was captured.)

690
00:30:05.970 --> 00:30:07.280
(All these things are connected.)

691
00:30:07.650 --> 00:30:09.280
(She's still pretending to be sick.)

692
00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:24.360
Princess Hua, your pulse

693
00:30:24.690 --> 00:30:26.970
seems perfectly normal to me.

694
00:30:30.690 --> 00:30:31.520
She must be

695
00:30:31.690 --> 00:30:33.360
happy to hear that you're here.

696
00:30:33.730 --> 00:30:34.800
That's why she's feeling better.

697
00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:37.210
I'm not entirely convinced.

698
00:30:37.890 --> 00:30:39.120
I do have a thought.

699
00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:41.210
In my opinion,

700
00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:42.690
there's nothing wrong

701
00:30:43.010 --> 00:30:44.450
with Princess Hua's body.

702
00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:46.520
The problem lies

703
00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:49.450
in her heart.

704
00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:52.080
It was revealed by His Majesty today

705
00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:52.600
that he intended to

706
00:30:52.730 --> 00:30:54.120
betroth you to Prince Ying.

707
00:30:54.730 --> 00:30:55.690
The moment you left the palace,

708
00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:57.080
you was scared by Prince Ying's horse

709
00:30:57.250 --> 00:30:57.890
and you fainted.

710
00:30:58.320 --> 00:30:59.690
Could you have pretended to be sick

711
00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:01.800
because you didn't want
to marry Prince Ying?

712
00:31:02.890 --> 00:31:03.930
Yes.

713
00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:05.520
No.

714
00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:13.320
How could I not want to marry him?

715
00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:23.970
The Hua family's motto reads

716
00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:27.120
"Ambitious and virtuous.
Work for the country."

717
00:31:28.650 --> 00:31:30.520
If this is His Majesty's wish,

718
00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:33.120
I will of course obey the decree.

719
00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:35.250
Doesn't it matter who you marry?

720
00:31:35.690 --> 00:31:37.450
Prince Ying has many good qualities.

721
00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:40.930
For example, he is very confident.

722
00:31:41.490 --> 00:31:42.490
Also,

723
00:31:45.010 --> 00:31:48.170
he is really confident.

724
00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:52.560
I like men who are confident.

725
00:31:56.730 --> 00:31:57.280
So,

726
00:31:59.210 --> 00:32:00.690
do you really want to marry him?

727
00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:03.490
His Majesty has already
issued the decree.

728
00:32:04.650 --> 00:32:06.930
I will of course obey the decree,

729
00:32:08.650 --> 00:32:10.410
but I still need

730
00:32:11.450 --> 00:32:13.450
some time to rest and recover.

731
00:32:14.210 --> 00:32:15.080
So...

732
00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:15.730
All right.

733
00:32:17.170 --> 00:32:17.840
Then, I

734
00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:20.120
will not disturb you, Princess Hua.

735
00:32:20.930 --> 00:32:22.210
Imperial Physician, let's go.

736
00:32:22.490 --> 00:32:23.040
Wait.

737
00:32:26.970 --> 00:32:27.600
What's wrong?

738
00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:28.930
Well,

739
00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:31.930
I would like to ask
the imperial physician to stay.

740
00:32:32.970 --> 00:32:34.970
My housekeeper Song

741
00:32:35.250 --> 00:32:36.800
was seriously injured

742
00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:38.040
on the battlefield.

743
00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:40.520
Now that Imperial Physician Jiang
has come to my house,

744
00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:42.890
can I trouble you

745
00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:44.080
to take a look at him?

746
00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:48.210
As for you, Your Highness,

747
00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:50.250
I won't keep you any longer.

748
00:32:50.970 --> 00:32:53.010
After all, in my family

749
00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:55.080
I can only serve you, Your Highness,

750
00:32:55.450 --> 00:32:56.970
with pancakes.

751
00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:59.010
Please don't mind that,

752
00:32:59.410 --> 00:33:00.760
Your Highness.

753
00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:10.320
Who would want to stay
and eat your food?

754
00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:12.210
That's unreasonable!

755
00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:14.520
Ba, after the imperial physician
returns to the palace,

756
00:33:14.890 --> 00:33:15.970
tell him to give Princess Hua

757
00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:16.930
the most bitter medicine.

758
00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:17.800
Then, come back

759
00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:19.280
and make sure

760
00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:20.650
Princess Hua drinks it all.

761
00:33:21.410 --> 00:33:22.320
Yes, Your Highness.

762
00:33:23.250 --> 00:33:23.730
Wait.

763
00:33:25.450 --> 00:33:26.600
Tell Jihuai to investigate

764
00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:28.320
the background of those assassins.

765
00:33:28.930 --> 00:33:29.360
Yes.

766
00:33:30.010 --> 00:33:31.490
(She sounded obedient,)

767
00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:33.730
(but she's sarcastic.)

768
00:33:33.890 --> 00:33:36.170
(She said she liked confident men.)

769
00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:01.360
I thank His Highness for his concern.

770
00:34:01.930 --> 00:34:03.410
However,

771
00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:04.930
I am taking medicine regularly.

772
00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:06.250
So...

773
00:34:06.690 --> 00:34:07.890
Please forgive me, Princess Hua.

774
00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:09.200
His Highness said

775
00:34:09.370 --> 00:34:10.490
you must finish

776
00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:11.240
all the medicine.

777
00:34:11.450 --> 00:34:13.160
Otherwise, I can't report to him.

778
00:34:13.370 --> 00:34:13.970
I might be beaten to death

779
00:34:13.970 --> 00:34:14.970
by His Highness.

780
00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:36.080
Thank you for saving
my life, Princess Hua.

781
00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:39.970
By the way, there's one more thing.

782
00:34:40.410 --> 00:34:41.080
Princess Hua,

783
00:34:41.290 --> 00:34:42.450
I'll deliver your medicine tomorrow.

784
00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:06.770
I thank His Highness for his concern.

785
00:35:14.490 --> 00:35:15.240
Candy!

786
00:35:15.450 --> 00:35:15.930
Sure.

787
00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:19.600
It's really awful.

788
00:35:22.490 --> 00:35:23.370
I'm so thirsty.

789
00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:24.370
Let me have a sip first.

790
00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:27.410
These two little rascals

791
00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:29.010
are simply foolish and sly.

792
00:35:29.410 --> 00:35:30.810
One said he was from the State Of Jin

793
00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:32.240
and was here to join in the fun.

794
00:35:32.490 --> 00:35:33.720
Do you know what the other said?

795
00:35:33.970 --> 00:35:34.850
He said he was thrown
into Hua's mansion

796
00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:36.240
in the middle of the night by someone.

797
00:35:36.450 --> 00:35:37.680
None of them admitted it.

798
00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:39.330
Can't you do anything about it?

799
00:35:41.290 --> 00:35:42.810
Your Highness, I'm with you every day.

800
00:35:43.410 --> 00:35:44.520
There must be a way.

801
00:35:44.810 --> 00:35:45.810
Since he insisted

802
00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:46.930
that he is from the State Of Jin,

803
00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:48.160
I asked them a question

804
00:35:48.330 --> 00:35:49.640
that every person knew
in the State Of Jin.

805
00:35:49.930 --> 00:35:50.810
I asked them,

806
00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:52.410
"What do you think of Crown Prince?"

807
00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:53.410
Guess what they said?

808
00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:54.810
They said

809
00:35:55.010 --> 00:35:57.120
you're diligent and caring, you
have both virtue and talent

810
00:35:57.330 --> 00:35:58.040
and guess what?

811
00:35:58.040 --> 00:35:59.450
"He's the role model in the country."

812
00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:00.600
It's obvious

813
00:36:00.810 --> 00:36:01.810
they're sent by the enemy.

814
00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:02.850
In the State Of Jin,

815
00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:03.850
who doesn't know

816
00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:04.640
you're...

817
00:36:06.010 --> 00:36:07.160
I think you look like

818
00:36:07.410 --> 00:36:08.720
an enemy sent here.

819
00:36:14.450 --> 00:36:15.040
Your Highness,

820
00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:18.970
these are special circumstances.

821
00:36:20.450 --> 00:36:22.640
So I just borrowed your name.

822
00:36:22.810 --> 00:36:24.120
Your Highness, you are magnanimous.

823
00:36:24.370 --> 00:36:26.680
You won't hold me accountable, will you?

824
00:36:27.490 --> 00:36:28.160
As for these little troublemakers,

825
00:36:28.410 --> 00:36:29.160
you can keep them.

826
00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:32.010
I'm so shocked.

827
00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:33.600
Prince Ying

828
00:36:33.810 --> 00:36:35.720
would actually do something like this

829
00:36:35.930 --> 00:36:36.720
to his future consort,

830
00:36:36.970 --> 00:36:38.850
despite knowing

831
00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:40.850
that she's physically weak.

832
00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:42.640
He ignored the guards' dissuasion,

833
00:36:42.850 --> 00:36:44.490
causing her to faint on the spot.

834
00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:46.010
The most infuriating thing is

835
00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:47.640
he still refuses

836
00:36:47.850 --> 00:36:49.200
to take responsibility.

837
00:36:49.410 --> 00:36:51.240
He even made the future consort

838
00:36:51.410 --> 00:36:52.410
apologise to him.

839
00:36:52.850 --> 00:36:53.680
It's pitiful.

840
00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:56.600
The future consort is weak and helpless,

841
00:36:56.810 --> 00:36:58.520
yet she has to publicly

842
00:36:58.720 --> 00:36:59.520
apologise to him.

843
00:36:59.770 --> 00:37:00.970
Prince Ying

844
00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:02.080
didn't even get a physician

845
00:37:02.290 --> 00:37:04.040
for the future consort.

846
00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:07.640
Instead, he left without
a care in the world.

847
00:37:09.290 --> 00:37:10.810
It's tragic.

848
00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:12.370
Is that all?

849
00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:14.040
It's indeed sad.

850
00:37:14.370 --> 00:37:15.080
Jihuai.

851
00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:18.450
Give him some money and
let him continue his story.

852
00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:31.820
(Calm and Elegant Melody)

853
00:37:34.290 --> 00:37:35.160
Mother,

854
00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:36.890
why do you want to see me?

855
00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:39.490
Have you heard

856
00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:40.890
of the rumors outside?

857
00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:42.200
The rumors?

858
00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:44.720
I see.

859
00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:46.200
Let them talk.

860
00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:48.290
I have already become

861
00:37:48.490 --> 00:37:49.490
the talk of the town

862
00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:50.720
ahead of Crown Prince.

863
00:37:50.930 --> 00:37:52.290
Isn't that a good thing?

864
00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:54.200
The thing is whether they're
saying good things about you.

865
00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:57.450
Isn't it because they're jealous

866
00:37:57.680 --> 00:37:58.720
that I am granted a marriage?

867
00:37:58.970 --> 00:37:59.850
They are just making things up.

868
00:38:00.770 --> 00:38:01.600
My foolish son,

869
00:38:01.850 --> 00:38:03.450
don't be so optimistic.

870
00:38:03.930 --> 00:38:05.410
You have to think about
who is jealous of you

871
00:38:05.490 --> 00:38:06.520
and wants to set you up.

872
00:38:07.930 --> 00:38:10.080
It must be...

873
00:38:10.290 --> 00:38:11.290
Crown Prince and the Hua family's

874
00:38:11.490 --> 00:38:13.330
young lady want to harm you.

875
00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:15.290
Crown Prince wants you to
marry the Hua family's daughter.

876
00:38:15.490 --> 00:38:16.850
It must be some kind of conspiracy.

877
00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:18.410
The Hua family's daughter

878
00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:20.120
deliberately tarnished your reputation.

879
00:38:20.330 --> 00:38:21.450
It's also a way to harm you.

880
00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:22.560
Mother,

881
00:38:23.450 --> 00:38:25.040
I think

882
00:38:25.290 --> 00:38:26.330
you get the wrong idea.

883
00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:28.770
Don't you remember

884
00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:29.810
what my father said that day?

885
00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:31.120
He wanted to find the best man

886
00:38:31.370 --> 00:38:32.850
in the State of Jin for Princess Hua.

887
00:38:33.290 --> 00:38:34.080
No one

888
00:38:34.330 --> 00:38:35.410
but me is good enough for her.

889
00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:36.560
As for Princess Hua,

890
00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:37.890
you don't have to worry about her.

891
00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:39.520
Why would she harm me?

892
00:38:39.770 --> 00:38:41.450
Why wouldn't she harm you?

893
00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:43.080
How does she harm me?

894
00:38:43.330 --> 00:38:43.850
She did it

895
00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:45.330
to catch my attention.

896
00:38:47.850 --> 00:38:49.160
Mother,

897
00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:51.330
you must be overthinking things.

898
00:38:51.770 --> 00:38:52.890
Please take a good rest.

899
00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:54.560
I'll greet my father.

900
00:39:00.450 --> 00:39:02.640
It seems that I have to take action.

901
00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:08.540
(Pretentious Moments)

902
00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:09.450
Your Highness.

903
00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:11.930
I've brought you something good.

904
00:39:12.290 --> 00:39:12.970
What is it?

905
00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:20.290
It's a game called
Cat, Mouse, and Cheese.

906
00:39:22.770 --> 00:39:23.970
Do you like it?

907
00:39:25.010 --> 00:39:27.810
I do. It's very sophisticated.

908
00:39:27.970 --> 00:39:29.330
Not this.

909
00:39:29.490 --> 00:39:30.770
There's something
even more sophisticated.

910
00:39:32.930 --> 00:39:33.850
Look at this cat paw belt.

911
00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:35.160
Look at the pattern on it.

912
00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:35.640
Also, this

913
00:39:36.010 --> 00:39:37.330
cat paw waist accessory.

914
00:39:37.330 --> 00:39:38.370
Come on, put it on me.

915
00:39:38.370 --> 00:39:39.600
Come on, give it a try.

916
00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:40.450
I think if you wear it,

917
00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:41.600
it will definitely suit you.

918
00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:42.720
Really?

919
00:39:42.970 --> 00:39:43.720
Take a look. Do you think so, too?

920
00:39:43.890 --> 00:39:44.490
The same style.

921
00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:45.040
The same style.

922
00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:47.930
Jihuai.

923
00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:49.970
Since you like cats so much,

924
00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:52.120
why don't you have one?

925
00:39:53.410 --> 00:39:53.930
Your Highness.

926
00:39:54.490 --> 00:39:55.930
Since you've asked,

927
00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:57.720
I will not hide it from you.

928
00:39:57.970 --> 00:39:58.520
Look.

929
00:39:58.720 --> 00:39:59.850
Sometimes, when you're busy,

930
00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:01.370
you don't have time to
take care of Fafa, right?

931
00:40:01.810 --> 00:40:02.520
So,

932
00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:03.890
I'm thinking of exchanging
this cat-themed chess piece

933
00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:05.120
and this belt

934
00:40:05.370 --> 00:40:07.290
for Fafa.

935
00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:10.370
Come here.

936
00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:11.890
Get lost.

937
00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:14.450
Leave the gifts.

938
00:40:15.770 --> 00:40:16.450
Your Highness.

939
00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:17.850
This is borrowed from someone else.
