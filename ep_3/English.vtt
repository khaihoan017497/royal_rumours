00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:22.440
why do we need to urgently

48
00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.320
hire people to clean the yard?

49
00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.370
You'll know by then.

This is the arrangement

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:33.810
The trees and the hills

54
00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.160
have to be arranged according to this.

55
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:36.920
No mistake is allowed.

Okay.

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:39.440
Uncle Song,

58
00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:40.530
I need you

59
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.010
to monitor them.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.290
Okay, I'll monitor them.

61
00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.090
Brew some hot tea for them

62
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.600
to warm themselves up.

63
00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.290
I'll need them

64
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.760
to take care of me.

65
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:51.370
Okay.

66
00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.370
Maybe I've come out for too long.

67
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.250
My sickness is relapsing.

68
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.600
Hurry, bring me back to the room.

69
00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:04.410
Let's go.

70
00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:13.920
Where should we put this, Yuan Wei?

71
00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:15.760
Put this there.

72
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:16.480
Okay.

73
00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.010
Put this there.

74
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.530
Okay.

75
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:19.130
Thank you.

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.920
Yuan Wei.

78
00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.880
Why are you alone?

79
00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:28.320
Why didn't you ask someone to help you?

80
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.090
Hey...

81
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.850
No need.

82
00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:30.720
Yuan Wei.

83
00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.810
This is nothing.

84
00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:33.920
I can do this.

85
00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:47.290
The few of you

86
00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:48.440
(Ambitious)
will need to plant some trees

87
00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.480
over there

88
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.530
and get some water here.

89
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:54.920
Put a few big rocks in the middle.

90
00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.640
That's it.

91
00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:56.350
Go back to work.

92
00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:57.410
- Okay, Yuan Wei.
- Okay, Yuan Wei.

93
00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:59.420
Yuan Wei.

94
00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:01.860
That's not right.

95
00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:03.670
(Earth)
It shouldn't be "earth"

96
00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.230
at this position.

97
00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:06.950
Miss said

98
00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.980
she wants to have two pieces of land

99
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:09.390
over there.

100
00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:10.580
She wants to plant vegetables

101
00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:11.580
during spring.

102
00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:14.300
I see.

103
00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:15.980
Okay.

104
00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.790
I'll get back to work now.

105
00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:17.380
Go ahead.

106
00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:26.060
Zhang,

107
00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:27.540
you must wipe the horse clean.

108
00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:28.540
I'll come and check later.

109
00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:29.300
Okay, Yuan Wei.

110
00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.710
Li.

111
00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.590
Get a few men

112
00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:35.670
to hang the clock.

113
00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:36.910
It has to be accurate.

114
00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.710
Okay.

115
00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:38.030
Go ahead.

116
00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.620
Yuan Wei.

117
00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:39.620
Good morning.

118
00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.710
Come over here, everyone.

119
00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:28.270
Miss said

120
00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:29.420
you can take a break.

121
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:33.980
You've been working the whole morning.

122
00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:35.350
Thank you.

123
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:36.980
Come and drink a cup of tea

124
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:38.230
to warm up your body.

125
00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:40.270
Here.

126
00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:41.270
Miss, you must be tired.

127
00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:42.980
I'm not as tired as you are.

128
00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:45.830
But my body

129
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.110
is really useless.

130
00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:49.980
Yuan Wei,

131
00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:52.300
help me to serve them tea.

132
00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:53.270
Okay.

133
00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:55.860
Come on, everyone. Drink tea.

134
00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:56.940
Come on.

135
00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:57.670
Thank you, Miss.

136
00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.030
- Thank you, Miss.
- Thank you, Miss.

137
00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:00.110
Bai, you've worked the hardest.

138
00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:00.860
You should drink first.

139
00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:03.710
Thank you, Yuan Wei.

140
00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:14.540
(Ankang Garden)
Your Highness.

141
00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:17.330
I'm so tired.

142
00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:18.890
I'll drink your tea, Your Highness.

143
00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:22.840
Why are you wearing that?

144
00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:25.400
It's convenient for me to work.

145
00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.280
Hold on a second.

146
00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:31.010
I ordered you to get someone
to spy on Hua family.

147
00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:32.640
Why are you working there now?

148
00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:34.400
It's a long story.

149
00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:35.810
It was a coincidence.

150
00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.080
Your Highness.

151
00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:38.520
Don't move.

152
00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:40.160
Sit down.

153
00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:41.330
Give it to me.

154
00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:42.600
I'm so tired.

155
00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:44.210
Your Highness,

156
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:46.040
let me tell you what happened.

157
00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:48.080
It went like this.

158
00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:49.300
(Protector General Mansion is hiring)
We're hiring!

159
00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:50.230
Come and take a look!

160
00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:51.860
Everyone, take a look!

161
00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:54.230

163
00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:55.860
I'm strong!

164
00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:57.030
Hire me!

165
00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:58.910
- Hire me!
- Move aside!

166
00:06:58.940 --> 00:06:59.740
Move aside!

167
00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:00.540
I.

168
00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:01.860
I can work every day.

169
00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:02.830
I'm on call any time.

170
00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:03.790
No overtime pay is needed.

171
00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:04.940
Who else can do this?

172
00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:06.940
Sorry.

173
00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:08.180
Miss has set

174
00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:09.180
the hiring requirements.

175
00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:10.030
You...

176
00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:16.270
Do you want to work?

177
00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:20.380
I want to work.

178
00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:21.300
My name is Bai.

179
00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:22.180
Thank you, Miss.

180
00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:23.910
I still don't understand.

181
00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:25.710
What are Princess Hua's requirements

182
00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:27.060
in hiring?

183
00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:31.030
A great general's soldiers
will not be weak.

184
00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:33.300
It's not strange that a capable man

185
00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:35.470
from Crown Prince Mansion is selected.

186
00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:42.230
After hearing what you said,

187
00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:44.420
I think I understand now.

188
00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:45.420
It looks like you're proud of yourself.

189
00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:49.470
No.

190
00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:50.470
Well,

191
00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:53.380
is Hua Liuli doing something lately?

192
00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:54.620
Of course.

193
00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:56.790
I've been talking to Princess Hua's

194
00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:58.150
servant, Yuan Wei,

195
00:07:58.300 --> 00:07:59.270
and working closely with her.

196
00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:00.860
Everything is under control.

197
00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:02.790
Also, Princess Hua doesn't seem

198
00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:04.350
to hate Your Highness.

199
00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:05.620
It's just that

200
00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:06.910
she's been cleaning the yard.

201
00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:09.150
The way she wants the yard to be

202
00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:10.540
is a bit weird.

203
00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:11.740
Why do you say so?

204
00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:15.230
I feel like
she's setting up a formation.

205
00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:21.590
I knew that this woman is not simple.

206
00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:23.060
She's simple.

207
00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:25.380
I don't think

208
00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:27.150
she's just pretending to be sick.

209
00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:28.540
She'd take some medicine.

210
00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:29.540
She looks sick.

211
00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:30.830
It looks like she'll fall down

212
00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:32.230
because of the strong wind.

213
00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:33.740
The strangest thing is that

214
00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:35.740
she was serving us tea

215
00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:36.860
by herself.

216
00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:38.470
So I think

217
00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:40.020
she's beautiful and kind.

218
00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:41.550
I feel like taking care of her.

219
00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:44.020
Don't forget she was lively

220
00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:45.660
in Jinling Garden.

221
00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:46.860
She was really agile.

222
00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:48.470
Jihuai,

223
00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:50.550
we can't just grill
one side of the meat.

224
00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:52.380
We can't just look at her appearance.

225
00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:53.950
Grill meat?

226
00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:57.710
Why are you still here?

227
00:08:57.860 --> 00:08:58.740
Go to work now.

228
00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:00.620
Your Highness,

229
00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:01.740
I'm leaving now.

230
00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:03.020
Please take care of yourself.

231
00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:04.260
Don't miss me too much.

232
00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:12.710
Why not grill meat tonight?

233
00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:16.660
What?

234
00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:17.470
What?

235
00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:18.980
Bai,

236
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:20.550
I'm sorry.

237
00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:22.260
Hua family

238
00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:24.190
does not need so many workers.

239
00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:25.900
I'll pay you

240
00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:28.070
three times for today.

241
00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:30.860
This is unfair.

242
00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:32.430
Why me?

243
00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:33.710
Yes, Miss.

244
00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:34.660
Bai is the most diligent

245
00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:35.740
and the best worker.

246
00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:36.950
Bai,

247
00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:38.140
I can tell

248
00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.110
how diligent you are,

249
00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:41.550
but happiness is
the most important thing

250
00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:43.070
for working here.

251
00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:44.860
You're excellent.

252
00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.660
The rest of them will feel tired.

253
00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:49.550
- Yes.
- Yes.

254
00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:52.780
So,

255
00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:55.020
please go and find another job.

256
00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:09.500
(Ambitious)

257
00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:25.220
(Happiness)

258
00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:35.140
Come on.

259
00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:36.260
Let's eat noodles.

260
00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:40.780
Uncle Song,

261
00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:42.190
this is

262
00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:44.140
- the taste of Qinghan Prefecture.
-The taste of Qinghan Prefecture.

263
00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:47.740
I miss

264
00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:48.900
the taste of Qinghan Prefecture too.

265
00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:52.590
I also wish to stay with General Hua.

266
00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:57.350
Uncle Song.

267
00:10:58.500 --> 00:10:59.860
We won.

268
00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:01.380
My parents are coming back soon.

269
00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:02.900
Let bygones

270
00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:04.350
be bygones.

271
00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:06.110
Yes.

272
00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:07.590
I'm thinking too much.

273
00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:11.020
Miss,

274
00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:12.500
the work is done.

275
00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:17.590
Thank you, Li.

276
00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:19.620
Please get the rest

277
00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:21.110
to take a break.

278
00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:22.020
Thank you, Miss.

279
00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:28.310
Miss, you're great.

280
00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:30.110
Everyone is working hard now.

281
00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:30.950
Of course.

282
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:34.140
Miss,

283
00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:35.550
I still don't get it.

284
00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:37.500
Why did you fire Bai?

285
00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:39.550
Did you notice that

286
00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:41.590
the others are working harder

287
00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:43.550
after Bai left?

288
00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:45.140
The yard has been tidied up

289
00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:46.550
in one afternoon.

290
00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:47.070
Yes.

291
00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:49.380
It's true.

292
00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:51.590
This is called

293
00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:54.550
"people do not suffer from being few,
but from lacking equal distribution".

294
00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:56.140
That's how people are.

295
00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:57.620
If someone

296
00:11:57.780 --> 00:11:58.620
is being outstanding,

297
00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:00.660
the rest wouldn't want to work anymore.

298
00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:01.780
It's...

299
00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:02.110
Furthermore,

300
00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:03.190
He's His Highness's subordinate.

301
00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:08.590
How did you get to know that?

302
00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:10.590
He's just diligent

303
00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:12.590
and he's His Highness's subordinate?

304
00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:15.260
Beg me.

305
00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:16.780
Please.

306
00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:19.590
I still won't tell you.

307
00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:21.380
Uncle Song.

308
00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:22.550
Yuan Wei,

309
00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:24.110
think about it.

310
00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:26.620
Why did he keep pleasing you?

311
00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:27.740
Also,

312
00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:29.550
he knew about the formation

313
00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:30.310
in the yard.

314
00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:32.470
Do you think he's an ordinary guy?

315
00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:38.310
Have you thought about...

316
00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:40.380
What if

317
00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:43.140
it's a coincidence?

318
00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:46.140
Let's eat.

319
00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:46.830
Miss, please eat the noodles.

320
00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:47.710
Let's eat.

321
00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:49.070
It's tasty.

322
00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:50.310
There are so many

323
00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:51.430
coincidences in the world.

324
00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:53.310
What if it's a coincidence?

325
00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:55.380
It's a coincidence.

326
00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:58.660
(Ankang Garden)

327
00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:12.950
Something is wrong with Princess Hua.

328
00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.310
I've been working so hard.

329
00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:17.740
I was the best worker,

330
00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:21.500
yet she fired me.

331
00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:23.780
I must find out

332
00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:25.260
her secrets.

333
00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:26.380
Why didn't you say that

334
00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:27.780
you've exposed yourself?

335
00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:30.500
No way!

336
00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:35.230
I'm the Junior Secretary of
the Supreme Court.

337
00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:36.070
How would she be able

338
00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:37.260
to expose me?

339
00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:38.900
Stop kidding.

340
00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:45.110
Your Highness,

341
00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:47.980
you must help me.

342
00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:49.900
There's still time.

343
00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:51.500
My late wife was

344
00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:53.350
colluding with others
and rising up in rebellion.

345
00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:55.190
The state of Jin could only
regain its strength

346
00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:56.620
after a few years.

347
00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:57.980
But I know

348
00:13:58.550 --> 00:13:59.980
her remnants

349
00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:02.550
are still staying in the state of Jin

350
00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:04.740
and waiting for the opportunity.

351
00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:06.950
I know that

352
00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:08.350
the remnants

353
00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:10.020
will not keep hiding.

354
00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:11.500
I have someone

355
00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:12.500
whom I'd like to verify.

356
00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:14.380
I've been spying for some time now.

357
00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:39.500
We

358
00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:41.900
have finally found the best timing.

359
00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:43.860
We have finally drugged

360
00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:45.550
Crown Prince's men.

361
00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:49.260
Keep the formation.

362
00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:55.740
Let's go.

363
00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:43.020
This time,

364
00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:44.830
we'll split.

365
00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:55.660
(Formation)

366
00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:24.990
Let's go.

367
00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:27.790
Are you okay?

368
00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:33.790
Let's go in.

369
00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:34.420
Let's go.

370
00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:30.220
Si, be careful!

371
00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:36.460
Assassin!

372
00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:52.030
(Ankang Garden)

373
00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:52.550
Your Highness,

374
00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:53.620
His Majesty asked me

375
00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:54.550
to bring these here.

376
00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:57.020
(Memorial)

377
00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:11.140
It's ridiculous.

378
00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:12.990
Is the capital too safe

379
00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:14.110
under ruling?

380
00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:15.350
They're handing in

381
00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:16.750
the memorials talking about

382
00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:18.420
the trivial matters.

383
00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:20.310
Your Highness,

384
00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:21.860
an assassin was found in

385
00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:22.940
Princess Hua's mansion.

386
00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:26.420
An assassin?

387
00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:31.180
Useless!

388
00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:35.460
(Hua Mansion)

389
00:19:42.550 --> 00:19:43.790
Your Highness,

390
00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:46.030
you're finally here.

391
00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:49.510
The capital is too dangerous.

392
00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:51.790
As soon as I woke up the morning...

393
00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:53.110
(She's acting again.)

394
00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:54.310
I saw...

395
00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:54.990
Yes,

396
00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:56.110
I woke up in the morning

397
00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:57.460
and saw this man lying down there.

398
00:19:57.620 --> 00:19:58.790
He's not moving

399
00:19:58.900 --> 00:19:59.750
and he's holding

400
00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:00.990
a long sword.

401
00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:01.990
Miss,

402
00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:03.860
someone in the capital
must be targeting at us.

403
00:20:04.030 --> 00:20:05.590
We should just go back
to Qinghan Prefecture.

404
00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:08.590
(Pei Jihuai is considered very smart,)

405
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:10.860
(but he was exposed so quickly.)

406
00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:13.460
(The yard seems)

407
00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:15.220
(normal,)

408
00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:16.830
(but it's hidden with mechanism.)

409
00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:19.700
(A few assassins will not be a threat.)

410
00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:26.620
(Hua Liuli, you're not simple.)

411
00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:29.310
He's indeed an assassin.

412
00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:31.270
But who was the person

413
00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:33.030
that overwhelmed the assassin
last night?

414
00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:36.660
I don't know.

415
00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:38.550
I thought

416
00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:41.030
Your Highness will protect me.

417
00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:42.510
But I didn't expect that

418
00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:45.070
the assassin still came in.

419
00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:47.220
Luckily my father favors me.

420
00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:49.350
He sent an expert, Uncle Song,

421
00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:50.900
and Yuan Wei to protect me.

422
00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:53.070
Otherwise, I couldn't have met

423
00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:56.220
Your Highness alive.

424
00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:03.990
(It seems like he's found out about it.)

425
00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:13.350
Your Highness,

426
00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:14.460
you should return the potatoes

427
00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:15.460
to us.

428
00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:16.860
We need to eat them.

429
00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:18.070
(It's fresh.)

430
00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:19.700
Your Highness, don't worry.

431
00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:21.140
I'm good at martial arts.

432
00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:22.590
I'll surely protect Miss.

433
00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:25.220
Qi. Ba.

434
00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:25.860
- Yes.
- Yes.

435
00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:27.590
Take him away.

436
00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:28.790
- Yes.
- Yes.

437
00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:32.420
I can't see this.

438
00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:35.510
They've taken him away.

439
00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:36.380
They've taken him away.

440
00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:40.350
Princess Hua, you have a gentle heart.

441
00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:42.030
You've decorated the yard

442
00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:44.030
in just a few days.

443
00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:45.860
Everyone here

444
00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:47.030
has changed as well.

445
00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:54.380
You'll enter the court to
meet His Majesty.

446
00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:56.310
Please prepare yourself well,

447
00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:57.110
Princess Hua.

448
00:21:57.860 --> 00:21:59.830
I'll prepare well for sure.

449
00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:02.380
Let's go.

450
00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:05.180
See you, Your Highness.

451
00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:13.590
Meeting His Majesty tomorrow

452
00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:15.700
will be another tough battle.

453
00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:19.750
(Ankang Garden)

454
00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:20.350
Your Highness.

455
00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:22.620
You're asking me to come so urgently.

456
00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:23.790
Did anything happen?

457
00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:26.860
Look at this.

458
00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:31.310
Isn't this a potato?

459
00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:33.700
I found this in

460
00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:34.790
Hua Mansion's yard

461
00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:36.140
next to the assassin's body.

462
00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:37.140
Take a look

463
00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:38.270
at the cut.

464
00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:44.860
Potato?

465
00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:47.030
They're using this potato

466
00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:48.380
as a hidden weapon.

467
00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:51.830
They're really using all kind of tricks.

468
00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:53.900
They have too many problems.

469
00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:55.380
Send more guards there.

470
00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:56.270
I'm worried.

471
00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:56.860
Sure.

472
00:22:57.030 --> 00:22:57.900
I'll send more guards there.

473
00:22:58.590 --> 00:22:59.070
Your Highness,

474
00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:00.070
what are you worried about?

475
00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:02.350
I'm worried about Princess Hua,

476
00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:04.140
the woman with schemes and plans.

477
00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:05.990
I'm now sure that

478
00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:07.220
under her beautiful skin,

479
00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:08.310
she's still the Hua Liuli

480
00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:10.270
who is cruel

481
00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:12.350
and stubborn.

482
00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:14.270
Okay, don't worry.

483
00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:15.460
I'll monitor her closely.

484
00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:35.940
Miss!

485
00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:37.270
Miss!

486
00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:38.420
You're running late!

487
00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:40.510
Miss!

488
00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:41.420
Get up!

489
00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:42.510
You need to meet His Majesty!

490
00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:43.790
Miss, let's go!

491
00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:45.350
Hurry. Wear your shoes.

492
00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:46.700
It's His Highness's fault

493
00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:47.940
that we're staying
in the western suburb.

494
00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:49.220
We need to wake up before dawn.

495
00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:49.860
Let's go.

496
00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:51.750
Hurry. We're running late.

497
00:23:56.550 --> 00:23:58.990
(Memorial)
Frame her.

498
00:24:05.790 --> 00:24:06.900
You'll look good wearing this

499
00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:07.900
or that?

500
00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:10.110
This?

501
00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:11.860
This?

502
00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:13.420
Wear them together?

503
00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:14.750
Do I look pale enough?

504
00:24:15.790 --> 00:24:17.270
Miss, stop patting it.

505
00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:18.350
It's red again.

506
00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:21.220
No worries.

507
00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:22.070
I'll continue

508
00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:22.900
in the carriage later.

509
00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:29.700
Yuan Wei.

510
00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:31.420
Go get

511
00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:32.620
the plainest dress for me.

512
00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:34.940
The plainest?

513
00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:36.590
I can't wear expensive dress today.

514
00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:39.220
Otherwise, I might lose my life.

515
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:40.990
I have a feeling that

516
00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:43.310
today will be a tough day.

517
00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:10.270
Miss,

518
00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:11.900
no matter how you pretend
to be a patient,

519
00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:12.860
your lips

520
00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:14.220
can't be covered.

521
00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:16.700
No way.

522
00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:18.460
I mustn't let it

523
00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:19.700
fail me as the sickly beauty.

524
00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:25.790
What's going on?

525
00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:36.380
(What I didn't want to happen
has happened.)

526
00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:40.420
Your Highness.

527
00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:42.110
Why are you here?

528
00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:43.380
I've promised to

529
00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:44.900
send you to greet His Majesty.

530
00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:46.220
How can I break my word?

531
00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:52.620
It seems like

532
00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:54.070
you've dressed up today

533
00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:55.620
and it's different from before.

534
00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:57.900
Do I look good?

535
00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:04.220
Your Highness, you're not
wearing simple today.

536
00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:11.860
What's your name again?

537
00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:13.660
Yuan Wei.

538
00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:14.550
Go back first.

539
00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:16.590
I'll send Princess Hua off today.

540
00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:18.180
Send her off?

541
00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:22.310
Yuan Wei.

542
00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:26.180
Since His Highness is sending me,

543
00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:27.460
you should go home first

544
00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:28.750
and do something else.

545
00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:32.350
Okay.

546
00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:34.700
Your Highness,

547
00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:35.660
here you go.

548
00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:36.420
This is

549
00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:37.550
the medicine to save her life.

550
00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:39.220
This is the medicine
when she's having short of breath.

551
00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:40.030
This is

552
00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:40.900
the medicine when the wind is blowing.

553
00:26:41.030 --> 00:26:42.590
This is the medicine
when she's going to faint.

554
00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:43.550
Your Highness,

555
00:26:43.550 --> 00:26:44.790
you must remember clearly.

556
00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:45.620
Her life

557
00:26:45.790 --> 00:26:46.620
is counting on you.

558
00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:57.510
Princess Hua, what have you prepared

559
00:26:57.830 --> 00:26:59.070
to meet His Majesty today?

560
00:26:59.510 --> 00:27:00.510
It's not easy to

561
00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:03.310
fool around in the court.

562
00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:06.140
I've prepared a gift for His Majesty.

563
00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:07.590
I'm sincere.

564
00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:08.350
Great.

565
00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:09.700
I'm looking forward to seeing that.

566
00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:11.790
But, I believe with your ability,

567
00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:13.900
giving pancake as a gift is the best.

568
00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:20.830
Your Highness.

569
00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:24.180
I think

570
00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:26.900
no matter what happened in the past,

571
00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:29.790
I was young and naive.

572
00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:30.790
Let bygones

573
00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:32.420
be bygones.

574
00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:37.420
Move aside!

575
00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:44.070
Move aside!

576
00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:50.460
(Prince Ying, Ji Yuanhao)

577
00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:56.140
I must get to the court

578
00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:57.350
before the Crown Prince is there.

579
00:27:59.420 --> 00:27:59.940
Move aside!

580
00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:11.660
Well,

581
00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:17.030
can you go back there now?

582
00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:18.830
I'm going back.

583
00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:22.110
I'm going back now.

584
00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:35.790
Who is being reckless out there?

585
00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:37.860
How dare they block
Hua family's carriage?

586
00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:39.900
It's Prince Ying.

587
00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:42.070
Why is His Highness

588
00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:43.620
in such a hurry?

589
00:28:44.270 --> 00:28:46.270
My eldest brother is diligent.

590
00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:48.550
He wants to be the first person
to reach the court.

591
00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:49.940
Surely he wants to rush his horse.

592
00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:52.860
I see.

593
00:28:55.270 --> 00:28:56.350
Your Highness,

594
00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:58.940
listening to the clattering
of the hooves of his horse

595
00:28:59.110 --> 00:29:00.030
can make me feel

596
00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:02.030
the power of his enthusiasm.

597
00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:04.900
He's even willing to mess up
the market with his horse.

598
00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:06.900
Your Highness,

599
00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:08.510
you mustn't lose to him.

600
00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:09.550
That's why I think

601
00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:11.220
you shouldn't waste time on

602
00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:12.940
sending me to the palace.

603
00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:14.940
Princess Hua, you don't know.

604
00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:16.420
The entire capital knows that

605
00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:18.180
I'm lazy.

606
00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:20.110
Princess Hua, you might be disappointed.

607
00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:21.350
(You've never been lazy)

608
00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:22.420
(when you're monitoring me.)

609
00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:23.350
Furthermore,

610
00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:25.990
I just like to

611
00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:28.180
stay with you.

612
00:29:28.790 --> 00:29:30.270
(Give me a break.)

613
00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:39.700
(Chenming Palace)

614
00:29:45.270 --> 00:29:45.990
Grand Preceptor.

615
00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:48.140
Let me help you.

616
00:29:53.790 --> 00:29:55.070
Your Highness.

617
00:29:55.550 --> 00:29:56.830
There should be affection
between father and son,

618
00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:58.140
righteousness between ruler and subject,

619
00:29:58.700 --> 00:29:59.940
(Grand Preceptor Du)
distinction between husband and wife,

620
00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:01.510
order between elder and younger,

621
00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:03.270
and trustworthiness between friends,

622
00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:07.070
so that the state can be
prosperous and enduring.

623
00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:10.310
Although I'm older,

624
00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:12.310
I'm just a subject.

625
00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:14.750
Your Highness,

626
00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:17.310
(Chenming Palace)
please go ahead.

627
00:30:17.790 --> 00:30:19.030
Your Highness.

628
00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:25.550
You don't have to wait for me.

629
00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:27.620
My body is weak.

630
00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:29.270
I can't walk anymore.

631
00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:33.110
Princess Hua, since you're weak,

632
00:30:34.110 --> 00:30:35.310
let me help you.

633
00:30:37.550 --> 00:30:38.990
Your Highness, I'm going to faint.

634
00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:42.110
He's not wearing the imperial robe
and not following rules.

635
00:30:42.270 --> 00:30:43.940
He's daring and lawless.

636
00:30:44.110 --> 00:30:45.350
He's even

637
00:30:45.550 --> 00:30:46.590
bullying a girl in public.

638
00:30:46.790 --> 00:30:48.110
Even though Hua family are hostages,

639
00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:49.590
they can't be treated like this.

640
00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:51.460
Your Highness,

641
00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:55.180
please be mindful of your words.

642
00:30:58.550 --> 00:31:00.180
I can't. I'm going to faint.

643
00:31:01.270 --> 00:31:02.220
I'm dizzy.

644
00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:03.380
I'm going to faint.

645
00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:08.550
The medicine for fainting.

646
00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:12.830
Take it and let's go.

647
00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:16.270
(He took the right one.)

648
00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:18.070
Wait at the side chamber later.

649
00:31:18.550 --> 00:31:19.900
Go in once you're summoned.

650
00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:21.180
Let's go.

651
00:31:21.550 --> 00:31:22.310
Follow me.

652
00:31:33.510 --> 00:31:34.220
Brother,

653
00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:35.620
your clothes

654
00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:36.790
are neat today.

655
00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:40.550
Are you in love with someone?

656
00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:43.350
Brother,
you've always been faster than me

657
00:31:43.790 --> 00:31:45.420
all these years.

658
00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:50.380
Minister Tian.

659
00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:53.270
You look a bit tired.

660
00:31:56.270 --> 00:31:58.420
What are you hiding in the sleeve?

661
00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:02.460
Thank you, Your Highness.

662
00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:16.220
- Long live Your Majesty!
- Long live Your Majesty!

663
00:32:16.550 --> 00:32:17.460
Rise.

664
00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:19.180
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

665
00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:23.140
Summon Princess Hua!

666
00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:35.310
Greetings, Your Majesty.

667
00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:37.990
Long live Your Majesty.

668
00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:40.460
Rise.

669
00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:41.700
Thank you, Your Majesty.

670
00:32:44.030 --> 00:32:46.510
I've finally met Your Majesty.

671
00:32:47.110 --> 00:32:48.590
Before I came here,

672
00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:50.620
my parents have mentioned

673
00:32:50.790 --> 00:32:52.310
many times to me

674
00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:54.700
how majestic Your Majesty is.

675
00:32:55.030 --> 00:32:56.030
After meeting Your Majesty,

676
00:32:56.270 --> 00:32:56.990
words

677
00:32:57.180 --> 00:32:58.660
can't describe

678
00:32:58.990 --> 00:33:00.620
how great Your Majesty is.

679
00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:05.030
My body is weak.

680
00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:07.990
Please forgive me.

681
00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:09.990
I didn't know Wei Mingyue's daughter

682
00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:11.460
is so weak.

683
00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:15.620
Are you happy staying in the capital?

684
00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:17.590
Since she has mentioned that,

685
00:33:17.790 --> 00:33:19.830
I want to take the chance to frame her.

686
00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:20.990
Yes.

687
00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:22.140
Your Majesty,

688
00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:24.380
I'm happy.

689
00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:26.310
As soon as I arrived in the capital,

690
00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:28.030
His Highness

691
00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:29.990
came to welcome me

692
00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:32.550
and he made all the arrangements well.

693
00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:34.270
I'm telling the truth.

694
00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:37.620
And all the officials here

695
00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:39.590
are taking good care of me.

696
00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:40.700
They've also given me

697
00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:42.030
a lot of gifts.

698
00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:44.270
Especially Minister Tian.

699
00:33:44.830 --> 00:33:45.660
He's given me

700
00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:47.030
a lot of textiles, silks,

701
00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:48.420
food and daily goods.

702
00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:49.990
He has even

703
00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:51.620
given me

704
00:33:51.790 --> 00:33:53.510
Jiamin's Night Pearl.

705
00:33:55.510 --> 00:33:57.110
Thank you, Minister Tian.

706
00:33:57.700 --> 00:33:59.110
That's my pleasure.

707
00:33:59.750 --> 00:34:01.180
When I was at the border,

708
00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:02.790
my father told me that

709
00:34:03.030 --> 00:34:04.830
everyone treats Hua family well.

710
00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:06.380
It seems like

711
00:34:06.550 --> 00:34:07.750
it's true.

712
00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:11.820
There's also Assistant Minister Yao.

713
00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:14.030
He knows that my parents

714
00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:15.550
like to play with swords and spears.

715
00:34:15.870 --> 00:34:17.180
He gave me

716
00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:18.470
a weapon chest

717
00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:20.590
with all the weapons

718
00:34:20.740 --> 00:34:21.910
inside.

719
00:34:24.220 --> 00:34:25.550
There's Censor Zhu too.

720
00:34:26.070 --> 00:34:27.220
He's also sent me

721
00:34:27.430 --> 00:34:28.740
a lot of food from the capital.

722
00:34:28.950 --> 00:34:29.990
There are varieties.

723
00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:31.390
I've gained weight

724
00:34:31.590 --> 00:34:33.340
these two days.

725
00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:35.070
Gentlemen,

726
00:34:35.550 --> 00:34:37.220
it's not as simple as it is.

727
00:34:37.910 --> 00:34:39.620
Let's not underestimate the enemy.

728
00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:45.950
You're right,

729
00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:48.700
but you don't need to worry.

730
00:34:49.110 --> 00:34:49.950
Why?

731
00:34:51.550 --> 00:34:55.180
We still have Plan B.

732
00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:56.030
Let me see.

733
00:34:59.030 --> 00:35:00.510
Official Lin has said that

734
00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:02.740
we can only open it

735
00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:05.990
in the court tomorrow.

736
00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:09.990
Your Majesty,

737
00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:12.340
I have a memorial here.

738
00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:15.950
It's given to me by the Grand Master
of Splendid Happiness,

739
00:35:16.110 --> 00:35:17.550
Lin Huizhi.

740
00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:18.910
He asked me to pass this

741
00:35:19.110 --> 00:35:21.340
to Your Majesty personally.

742
00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:37.990
Your Majesty, greetings.

743
00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:40.510
I used to advice in the court that

744
00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:42.820
Hua Army was waging war
in times of poverty.

745
00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:46.820
I was to resign and be transferred to
another province as punishment.

746
00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:49.390
Who knows I met Princess Hua

747
00:35:49.590 --> 00:35:50.910
at the suburban post station.

748
00:35:52.110 --> 00:35:53.260
Let's eat.

749
00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:55.870
Hurry.

750
00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:57.870
Excuse me.

751
00:35:58.220 --> 00:36:00.510
(Lin Huizhi)
What has this old man done

752
00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:02.820
to be locked by the heavy metal?

753
00:36:03.550 --> 00:36:05.180
This sinful official framed General Hua

754
00:36:05.390 --> 00:36:07.220
about him waging war
in times of poverty,

755
00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:09.180
and solders killing at the border.

756
00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:10.620
It has offended His Majesty

757
00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:12.340
and he's being exiled.

758
00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:14.660
It's considered a light punishment.

759
00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:16.390
You're young

760
00:36:16.590 --> 00:36:17.870
yet you're so cruel.

761
00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:19.220
As an official,

762
00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:20.700
I'm loyal to the imperial court

763
00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:21.950
and dedicated to serving the people.

764
00:36:22.070 --> 00:36:23.870
Hua Yingting is waging war everywhere

765
00:36:24.070 --> 00:36:25.780
and spending all people's money.

766
00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:29.740
Jinpo

767
00:36:29.950 --> 00:36:31.220
keeps intruding our territory.

768
00:36:31.390 --> 00:36:32.620
If we don't fight back,

769
00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:34.470
should we just let them do
whatever they want?

770
00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:36.550
You keep talking about
serving the people

771
00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:38.110
but actually,

772
00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:39.990
you don't care about the people
at the border.

773
00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:41.430
What's this called?

774
00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:42.910
Hypocrite!

775
00:36:43.870 --> 00:36:45.340
You young ladies

776
00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:46.870
are running your mouths!

777
00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:48.140
The meal is here.

778
00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:49.430
The meal is here.

779
00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:50.820
Hello,

780
00:36:50.990 --> 00:36:51.780
this is his meal.

781
00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:53.340
Yuan Wei.

782
00:36:53.950 --> 00:36:54.260
Miss.

783
00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:55.910
I feel dizzy suddenly.

784
00:36:56.470 --> 00:36:57.820
I feel like vomiting.

785
00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:00.430
I can't smell the meat.

786
00:37:00.590 --> 00:37:01.470
Throw it away.

787
00:37:01.550 --> 00:37:01.870
Okay.

788
00:37:02.070 --> 00:37:02.740
What do you mean?

789
00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:10.300
Please,

790
00:37:10.590 --> 00:37:11.820
help this officer

791
00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:12.620
get another bowl of rice.

792
00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:13.300
Remember

793
00:37:13.470 --> 00:37:15.300
not to add any meat.

794
00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:16.660
What do you mean?

795
00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:17.510
Official,

796
00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:19.180
you're being exiled.

797
00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:20.590
Why are you eating meat?

798
00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:21.870
The people at the border

799
00:37:22.070 --> 00:37:23.220
can seldom eat meat.

800
00:37:23.870 --> 00:37:25.550
Aren't you dedicated to serving
the nation and the people?

801
00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:26.870
Surely

802
00:37:27.070 --> 00:37:28.590
you need to suffer together
with the people.

803
00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:31.220
Princess Hua is odd

804
00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:32.700
and arrogant.

805
00:37:33.220 --> 00:37:34.220
I think

806
00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:36.740
she's been taught by Hua family

807
00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:38.950
so she's holding grudges.

808
00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:40.470
Hua Liuli,

809
00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:42.220
how dare you...

810
00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:44.190
Lin Huizhi

811
00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:46.030
might have been exiled,

812
00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:48.070
but he was

813
00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:49.990
an imperial officer.

814
00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:51.300
Hua Liuli,

815
00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:53.660
you're arrogant,

816
00:37:54.140 --> 00:37:54.820
aren't you?

817
00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:55.780
I dare not

818
00:37:55.950 --> 00:37:58.180
think about this.

819
00:37:58.470 --> 00:37:59.910
Official Lin Huizhi

820
00:38:00.070 --> 00:38:01.620
must have suffered a lot.

821
00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:02.300
Yes.

822
00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:04.620
Princess Hua's behavior

823
00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:06.430
is too much.

824
00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:16.100
(Pretentious hour)

825
00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:18.820
Hello, Flower Goddess.

826
00:38:18.910 --> 00:38:20.770
I'm here today to ask for
a romance relationship.

827
00:38:20.770 --> 00:38:22.210
I wish to have a nice husband.

828
00:38:22.210 --> 00:38:24.280
He must be handsome and reliable.

829
00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:25.180
He must treat me well.

830
00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:26.720
I just don't want someone

831
00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:27.430
like Pei Jihuai.

832
00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:28.820
Thank you.

833
00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:31.820
This is the place.

834
00:38:31.950 --> 00:38:33.340
Flower Goddess Temple is efficacious.

835
00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:34.260
You can ask for anything

836
00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:35.590
but marriage.

837
00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:36.300
Yes.

838
00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:37.390
I heard about that too.

839
00:38:37.470 --> 00:38:38.590
Let's go in and pray later.

840
00:38:38.590 --> 00:38:38.870
Yes.

841
00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:40.430
Let's pray for our family.

842
00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:41.430
Yes, don't pray for marriage.

843
00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:42.550
Let's pray.
