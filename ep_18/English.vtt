Bravo!

18
00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:50.980
(Jinpo)

19
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.960
Your Highness,

20
00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:08.600
would you like to

21
00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.160
meet Princess Hua?

22
00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:11.480
No.

23
00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.010
Let's not disturb her.

24
00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:17.690
Surprisingly, Princess Hua

25
00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:18.970
does it effortlessly.

26
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.440
It seems that she's indeed
the best candidate

27
00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:23.920
for the post of Ceremonial Officer,

28
00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.880
thanks to your wisdom,
Your Highness.

29
00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.760
Officer Hua,

30
00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:29.600
please sit.

31
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:32.720
Please sit.

32
00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:33.290
Sit.

33
00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.850
Here.

34
00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.040
Fill it to the brim!

35
00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.160
Thank you.

36
00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:37.690
Cheers!

37
00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:38.720
Cheers!

38
00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:43.600
Fill it to the brim!

39
00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:44.370
Prepare some

40
00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.880
heat-clearing herbal tea

41
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.880
and something for her to sober up later.

42
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.290
Yes, Your Highness.

43
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:50.530
Fill it to the brim!

44
00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.970
Life is short.

45
00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.760
Cherish the time you have!

46
00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.410
After Junior Secretary Pei left,

47
00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.370
he's been wailing like this!

48
00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:08.690
Other prisoners

49
00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.880
can't take it anymore.

50
00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.880
They'd rather be crammed six to a cell,

51
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.480
far away from here.

52
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.370
Life…

53
00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.200
Stop!

54
00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.290
The second prince of Jinpo

55
00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.970
will arrive soon.

56
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.850
Behave yourself!

57
00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.880
What?

58
00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.410
Second Prince is coming?

59
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:23.640
Then I, A'Wa,

60
00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.760
will die for my country today!

61
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.250
Luckily, after
Junior Secretary Pei left,

62
00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.130
he gave instructions.

63
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.440
I have a solid bond with Second Prince.

64
00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.570
Not even considering personal safety,

65
00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.200
he braves the treacherous

66
00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:41.970
State of Jin full of wily foxes.

67
00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:43.920
He's coming to save me for sure!

68
00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:45.760
My dear Second Prince,

69
00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:47.250
you're really a good prince

70
00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.160
that loves Jinpo and its people!

71
00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.370
If anything goes wrong,

72
00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.010
anyone can have

73
00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:57.040
a hold over me.

74
00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.810
How can I

75
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.690
let Second Prince

76
00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.810
be caught in a dilemma?

77
00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.530
Life is short.

78
00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.160
Cherish the time you have.

79
00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.160
Enough! I've had enough!

80
00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.920
Die if you wish!

81
00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.050
Just don't ram your head into the wall!

82
00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:17.960
We don't want to have a hard time

83
00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.490
cleaning up your mashed brain!

84
00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:20.610
Use the white fabric

85
00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:21.690
to hang yourself!

86
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:22.490
Hanging isn't a good choice!

87
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.400
Stab yourself in the chest
with the scissors

88
00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.130
or slit your throat with the cleaver!

89
00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.280
General A'Wa,

90
00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.440
you're good at martial arts.

91
00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:29.930
You can surely kill
yourself swiftly, right?

92
00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:31.170
You know what?

93
00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.050
Once, I helped my wife to kill
a chicken by slitting its throat.

94
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:35.320
It didn't die.

95
00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:36.280
It ran all over

96
00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:37.320
the yard

97
00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.610
with blood spurting.

98
00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:41.320
General A'Wa,

99
00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:42.840
you should be able to strike
yourself at the right spot

100
00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.320
and die fast.

101
00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:45.690
I trust you.

102
00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.690
Let's go.

103
00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.760
Come and rescue me, Second Prince.

104
00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:07.730
I don't want to die!

105
00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:15.460
(The Capital)

106
00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:25.010
Your Highness.

107
00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:26.840
I've heard that

108
00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.010
the second prince of Jinpo
will be visiting today.

109
00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.960
That's right.

110
00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:32.260
I've been waiting

111
00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:33.730
for almost two hours.

112
00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:34.570
By the way, Your Highness,

113
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.960
is "Princess Fushou"

114
00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:38.610
the name that you like?

115
00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:41.930
How did you know?

116
00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:45.250
Your Highness, your royal retreat
is called Ankang Garden.

117
00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.200
So, it isn't hard to find out.

118
00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.130
Don't you like it?

119
00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:51.170
I'm okay with it.

120
00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:52.760
"Fushou Ankang"
[*Blessing, Longevity, Peace and Health]

121
00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:54.250
sounds auspicious.

122
00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.010
I'm glad that you like it.

123
00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:56.960
It took me a long time

124
00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:58.200
to think of the right name.

125
00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:07.050
They're here.

126
00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:50.760
Your Highness.

127
00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:51.730
Princess Hua,

128
00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:53.320
I didn't expect

129
00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:54.400
to be received by you.

130
00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:56.880
I'm surprised.

131
00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:59.520
I was worried that Your Highness

132
00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:00.610
couldn't find

133
00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:01.840
the city gate

134
00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:02.760
of the capital.

135
00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:05.010
Jinpo is indeed

136
00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:06.490
an impressive state

137
00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:08.170
to have arrived last.

138
00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.810
That reflects

139
00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.690
Jinpo's sincerity.

140
00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:15.440
May I personally see
the Emperor of the State of Jin

141
00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:17.250
to present the big gift from Jinpo?

142
00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:21.370
I can't wait.

143
00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:31.080
Welcoming Second Prince
of Jinpo, He Yuanting.

144
00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:55.730
Greetings, Your Majesty.

145
00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:57.200
Greetings, Your Majesty.

146
00:07:57.570 --> 00:07:59.050
Formality exempted.

147
00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:00.170
Thank you, Your Majesty.

148
00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:04.610
Your emissaries have just
had a difficult journey.

149
00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.170
Why didn't you settle down

150
00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:08.490
and rest before seeing me?

151
00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.280
I heard that

152
00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:12.730
we arrived last in the State of Jin.

153
00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:15.840
To express our sincerity and apology,

154
00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:17.930
we're specially presenting

155
00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:19.810
a great beauty.

156
00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:07.250
Bravo!

157
00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.010
Beautiful!

158
00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:10.680
She's extremely beautiful!

159
00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.560
However, the imperial harem

160
00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:18.090
has been fully occupied, right?

161
00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:21.730
We stop accepting concubines.

162
00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:23.490
However,

163
00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.370
this is an order from the king of Jinpo.

164
00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:29.160
If you don't accept her, Your Majesty,

165
00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:31.560
then the girl is for your crown prince.

166
00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.160
(Save her for yourself.)

167
00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:34.280
(Don't you dare!)

168
00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:37.090
My son,

169
00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:38.610
Second Prince

170
00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.160
is offering the beauty

171
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.400
to you.

172
00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:48.010
Thank you, father.

173
00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:01.610
(Your Highness,)

174
00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:03.090
(you won't change your mind
for the beauty, right?)

175
00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:04.640
Jiang Sha,

176
00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:07.160
greet your new master.

177
00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:11.800
Nice to meet you, Your Highness.

178
00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:18.040
(If you accept her,
you'll be in trouble.)

179
00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:41.010
Your Highness, since you have

180
00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:42.010
offered her to me,

181
00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:43.010
I have the right

182
00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:44.040
to decide what to do.

183
00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:45.250
Of course.

184
00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:48.370
Good.

185
00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:50.920
My official residence
operates with tough rules.

186
00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:53.330
Candidates are at least
required to attend Qinghe School

187
00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:54.880
to learn and study hard

188
00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:56.400
with different methods.

189
00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:04.210
So, let's send this beauty

190
00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:06.090
to the school first.

191
00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:07.850
When she has become learned,

192
00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:09.400
I'll welcome her to
the official residence.

193
00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:11.130
(You're wise.)

194
00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:12.760
Your Highness,

195
00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:14.880
what place is it again?

196
00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:17.330
Guards, send her to

197
00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:18.490
Qinghe School.

198
00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:33.580
(Ceremonial Hall)

199
00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:38.370
Hello, Princess Hua.

200
00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:42.490
Today, there're negotiations

201
00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:44.090
with Jinpo representatives.

202
00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:46.040
You'd better behave yourself.

203
00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:48.010
In terms of sentiment,

204
00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:49.040
I will,

205
00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:52.330
but I'm the second prince after all.

206
00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:53.490
At the same time,

207
00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:56.130
I'm very nostalgic.

208
00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:58.370
I'm warning you.

209
00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:00.280
Stop talking nonsense.

210
00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:01.880
Also,

211
00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:04.130
don't forget your status.

212
00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.370
Jinpo

213
00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:08.490
has lost.

214
00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:14.370
You're nostalgic, too.

215
00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:22.280
Your Highness.

216
00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:23.640
What brought you here?

217
00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:24.400
Are you going with me

218
00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:25.450
for the negotiations?

219
00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:27.560
I'm here to show support.

220
00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.330
Do you remember

221
00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:31.250
what I've told you?

222
00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:32.520
Of course I do!

223
00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:35.040
He Yuan…

224
00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:39.920
Just remember that
besides negotiations,

225
00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:42.160
you both shouldn't talk
about anything else.

226
00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:43.130
Of course.

227
00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:44.490
I don't wish

228
00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:45.400
to talk about other things with him.

229
00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:49.610
Let me have a look.

230
00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:52.520
Let's neaten this.

231
00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:00.010
Your hat is tilted.

232
00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:03.850
Is it okay now?

233
00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:04.970
Don't move.

234
00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:29.040
Well,

235
00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:30.760
the negotiations should be

236
00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:32.090
done and concluded swiftly.

237
00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:33.970
Remember not to get

238
00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:36.130
entangled with them.

239
00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:40.370
Bye.

240
00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:48.560
Miss,

241
00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:49.520
what's wrong with your head?

242
00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:50.210
Is it aching?

243
00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:53.250
Well, the hat is tilted.

244
00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:05.250
Princess Hua.

245
00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:06.800
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

246
00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:09.970
Grand Preceptor Du has asked us

247
00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:11.800
to help you, Princess Hua.

248
00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:13.920
(Another nitpicker.)

249
00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:15.680
(Let's hope that they will
side with us against Jinpo.)

250
00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:17.680
Thank you

251
00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:18.970
for your support.

252
00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:25.210
(We beat Jinpo in the battle.)

253
00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:26.880
(Naturally, we have more)

254
00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:27.780
(bargaining power in the negotiations.)

255
00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:28.980
(Envoy of Ansheng.
Ceremonial Officer.)

256
00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:30.520
(However, He Yuanting)

257
00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:31.520
(is cunning.)

258
00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:33.400
(There might be hidden tricks.)

259
00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:36.090
(I have to be careful.)

260
00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:53.130
Officer Hua,

261
00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:55.400
you're the head of Ceremonial Hall.

262
00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:57.400
You should preside
over the negotiations.

263
00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:06.490
Jinpo has been bullying other states.

264
00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:08.970
You're defeated now.

265
00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.520
However, the State of Jin has
always been magnanimous.

266
00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:14.450
So we won't exploit another state

267
00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:15.680
in terms of conditions.

268
00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:17.450
The treaty that

269
00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:18.800
we have here

270
00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:20.400
states all the conditions

271
00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:21.850
for the negotiations.

272
00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:23.010
Please have a look.

273
00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:27.850
You're right, Officer.

274
00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:30.090
However, despite the defeat,

275
00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:32.520
Jinpo is not to be
treated like a nobody.

276
00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:34.610
As long as the conditions
are reasonable,

277
00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:35.970
Jinpo will not reject

278
00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:36.880
the treaty.

279
00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:38.130
That's right.

280
00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:41.420
(Treaty)

281
00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:43.450
Prisoner exchange.

282
00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:45.760
No problem.

283
00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:48.880
Regular trades.

284
00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:51.850
This is a beneficial strategy
for the states and the citizens.

285
00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:25.580
(Grand Preceptor Mansion)

286
00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:27.800
Great-grandfather, drink slowly.

287
00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:29.520
The medicine can cure you.

288
00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:33.130
Take more.

289
00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:35.370
Here.

290
00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:38.850
Great-grandfather.

291
00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:43.040
Xiuying,

292
00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:44.880
is today the day

293
00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:46.730
for the negotiations with Jinpo?

294
00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:48.370
Yes, great-grandfather.

295
00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:52.040
Princess Hua

296
00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:55.680
is the main negotiator.

297
00:16:57.370 --> 00:16:59.610
I'm worried as she's inexperienced.

298
00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:01.610
Great-grandfather,

299
00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:03.450
she may be young,

300
00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:05.600
but she manages things
well and maturely.

301
00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:06.930
Don't worry.

302
00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:13.280
Jinpo has always been cunning.

303
00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:17.250
Things may not be easy.

304
00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:22.120
Officer Hua,

305
00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:24.490
the negotiations today

306
00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:25.890
seem to be going smoothly so far.

307
00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:28.690
Official Tian.

308
00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:29.930
Official Tian,

309
00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:33.210
if the negotiations go on like this,

310
00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:36.080
the signing of the treaty

311
00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:38.010
will take place soon.

312
00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:41.970
Everyone,

313
00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:44.170
the matter is not

314
00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:45.170
as simple as it looks.

315
00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:47.460
(Treaty)

316
00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:52.360
The demand for the boundary

317
00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:54.320
of the Qinghan steppe to recede by 250km

318
00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:57.970
is unacceptable.

319
00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:02.320
The Qinghan steppe
has always belonged

320
00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:03.970
to the State of Jin.

321
00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:06.010
Why do you disagree?

322
00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:08.210
What do you mean by "always'?

323
00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:10.730
As far as I remember,

324
00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:11.560
the steppe of Qinghan Prefecture

325
00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:13.410
belongs to Jinpo.

326
00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:14.970
Are you saying that

327
00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:16.250
you disagree with the condition?

328
00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:19.120
Yes, we disagree.

329
00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:21.410
The delineation is the key

330
00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:22.840
item on the agenda.

331
00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:25.450
Have you been

332
00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:26.520
beating around the bush

333
00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:28.410
just to reject the condition?

334
00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:30.250
Ridiculous!

335
00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:32.250
Your state was defeated

336
00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:33.690
and you still have the audacity
to reject the condition.

337
00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:37.280
You shouldn't say so,

338
00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:37.760
Officer Hua.

339
00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:39.840
If I let the boundary

340
00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:40.760
recede by 250km,

341
00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:43.970
I'm afraid the furious people of Jinpo

342
00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:45.600
will demand to fight back.

343
00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:49.040
I think that going into another battle

344
00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:50.970
isn't something you

345
00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:52.170
favour, Officer. Am I right?

346
00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:59.320
Considering our past relationship,

347
00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:02.040
why don't you give in, Officer Hua?

348
00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:05.040
Relationship my foot!

349
00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:10.360
Your Highness.

350
00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:13.040
It took him just a few words

351
00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:14.010
to make you mad.

352
00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:15.800
You're too young for the job.

353
00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:22.490
Offer Princess Hua a cup of tea

354
00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:24.410
to calm down.

355
00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:26.010
Also,

356
00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:28.210
replace her chair

357
00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:30.450
with one that has no back.

358
00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:32.170
Why?

359
00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:34.210
She needs to straighten up

360
00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:36.320
without losing the morale.

361
00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:39.320
(Past relationship?)

362
00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:42.040
(I want to see him in person.)

363
00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:52.890
Officer Hua,

364
00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:55.210
there's been no progress.

365
00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:56.890
Why don't we strategise among ourselves?

366
00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:00.930
That's all for today.

367
00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:02.970
Since Jinpo isn't genuine,

368
00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:04.320
we'll resume the negotiations
some other day.

369
00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:06.250
Hold on, Officer Hua.

370
00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:10.280
What's the matter?

371
00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:11.600
Is there anything else,

372
00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:12.840
Your Highness?

373
00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:15.800
I've heard that you

374
00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:17.600
have constructed a street nearby

375
00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:20.450
for inter-state trade, bartering

376
00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:21.930
and a display of
the states' unique products.

377
00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:25.970
Officer Hua, would you be kind enough

378
00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:27.890
to show me around?

379
00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:30.040
Thanks for your invitation,
Your Highness.

380
00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:32.730
However, I have important
matters to attend to today.

381
00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:34.250
Please excuse me.

382
00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:35.970
Crown Prince has arrived.

383
00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:49.040
Since you're interested,

384
00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:52.250
I'll show you around.

385
00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:56.600
It's the most ideal for

386
00:20:57.450 --> 00:20:59.600
the crown prince to offer me a tour.

387
00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:01.250
If if it's convenient, Officer Hua

388
00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:02.730
can join us.

389
00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:04.490
Let's go.

390
00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:07.210
(What's on the crown prince's mind?)

391
00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:09.560
Officer Hua, what shall we do now?

392
00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:11.280
Let's join them first.

393
00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:12.410
Sure.

394
00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:14.080
By the way, Officer Hua,

395
00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:15.970
do you observe that

396
00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:17.840
His Highness and

397
00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:19.280
the second prince of Jinpo

398
00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:21.800
have been clashing with each other?

399
00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:26.780
(Longjing Street)

400
00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:28.930
Bravo!

401
00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:43.600
What is depicted on this?

402
00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:45.170
What a special motif.

403
00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:47.320
It's a lion.

404
00:21:47.490 --> 00:21:48.800
It's a holy beast of the State of Mosi.

405
00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:50.080
Lions don't exist here.

406
00:21:51.170 --> 00:21:52.840
I've read about them in some classics.

407
00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:54.170
They have limbs

408
00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:55.730
that are as strong as dogs',

409
00:21:55.890 --> 00:21:57.120
but their heads are huge with manes.

410
00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:58.490
Their tails are long with
hairy tufts at the tips.

411
00:21:58.600 --> 00:21:59.890
They are exotic and interesting.

412
00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:02.040
Seeing is believing.

413
00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:02.800
Since we're having negotiations,

414
00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:04.410
I'll have the State of Mosi
send two lions

415
00:22:04.650 --> 00:22:05.730
and present one of them to you.

416
00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:07.560
You can keep it at
your courtyard as a pet

417
00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:09.760
like Fafa.

418
00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:12.450
Let's go.

419
00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:18.800
Is this Korean ginseng?

420
00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:19.520
Yes.

421
00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:20.690
Judging by the big root,

422
00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:22.010
it must have aged for at least 30 years.

423
00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:24.210
It's indeed a valuable herb.

424
00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:25.890
This looks like

425
00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:27.450
a shrivelled carrot.

426
00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:30.170
For your information, Princess Hua,

427
00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:31.600
Korean ginseng

428
00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:33.490
helps to replenish Qi and blood.

429
00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:35.010
I've heard that

430
00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:36.890
the battles you've fought

431
00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:38.560
have caused you long illnesses.

432
00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:40.600
May I buy it

433
00:22:40.890 --> 00:22:42.490
for you, Princess Hua?

434
00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:43.320
That's unnecessary.

435
00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:44.120
It's too expensive.

436
00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:44.890
I want it.

437
00:22:45.410 --> 00:22:46.560
I want it.

438
00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:50.760
Your Highness,

439
00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:51.930
I remember that

440
00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:53.930
there're still some ginseng roots

441
00:22:53.970 --> 00:22:55.650
among the gifts you gave me.

442
00:22:57.250 --> 00:22:58.080
Do you mean

443
00:22:58.210 --> 00:22:59.800
the boxes of ginseng I took

444
00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:01.520
from His Majesty's treasury?

445
00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:03.040
It's been so long that

446
00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:04.040
I've almost forgotten.

447
00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:07.010
Besides, I think

448
00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:08.280
the ginseng roots you gave me

449
00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:09.800
are much bigger than this.

450
00:23:10.010 --> 00:23:11.170
Going by that,

451
00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:11.760
have they aged for

452
00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:13.010
more than 100 years?

453
00:23:13.730 --> 00:23:15.120
If you like them,

454
00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:16.250
I'll take you to the treasury

455
00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:17.010
and you can help yourself.

456
00:23:17.410 --> 00:23:18.800
In that case,

457
00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:21.210
I shouldn't do the unnecessary.

458
00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:23.410
Thanks for your kind
intention, Your Highness.

459
00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:25.280
Jinpo is located in the northwest.

460
00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:27.250
However, ginseng is
grown in the southwest.

461
00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:28.650
So it's understandable

462
00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:29.600
that ginseng is rarely seen in Jinpo.

463
00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:30.560
Princess Hua,

464
00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:31.650
let's move on.

465
00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:38.900
(Qunying Eatery)

466
00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:01.120
Please help yourself.

467
00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:04.840
Please help yourself.

468
00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:08.010
Please help yourself.

469
00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:14.930
Please help yourself.

470
00:24:17.730 --> 00:24:18.040
Please help yourself.

471
00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:18.970
Let's eat together.

472
00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:20.970
Please help yourselves.

473
00:24:29.010 --> 00:24:29.840
Second Prince,

474
00:24:30.210 --> 00:24:31.490
this is the most famous eatery

475
00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:32.560
in the capital of the State of Jin.

476
00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:33.890
Every dish

477
00:24:33.970 --> 00:24:35.210
is unique.

478
00:24:36.450 --> 00:24:37.930
However, I think

479
00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:40.080
compared to the street food

480
00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:41.010
at the marketplace
launched by Princess Hua,

481
00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:42.970
the dishes here lack
a distinctive style.

482
00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:45.320
Really?

483
00:24:47.730 --> 00:24:48.970
When I'm free,

484
00:24:49.010 --> 00:24:50.170
I'll definitely try the food there.

485
00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:53.320
Princess Hua,

486
00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:55.080
I remember that

487
00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:57.320
you've told me before

488
00:24:57.410 --> 00:24:59.080
that you like mutton the most.

489
00:24:59.890 --> 00:25:00.410
Here,

490
00:25:01.210 --> 00:25:02.450
try this.

491
00:25:08.490 --> 00:25:09.650
However, based on

492
00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:12.360
our barbecue experience,

493
00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:14.040
Princess Hua's favourite food

494
00:25:17.010 --> 00:25:18.120
is beef.

495
00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:35.080
My favourite is

496
00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:36.490
of course beef.

497
00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:37.890
Beef.

498
00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:48.890
I've long heard

499
00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:50.320
that the people of the State of Jin

500
00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:52.250
don't drink as well as
the people of Jinpo.

501
00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:54.890
Your Highness,

502
00:25:57.840 --> 00:25:58.560
cheers.

503
00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:05.840
Cheers.

504
00:26:08.170 --> 00:26:08.840
Cheers.

505
00:26:09.490 --> 00:26:10.080
Cheers.

506
00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:23.690
Yuan Wei,

507
00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:25.210
His Highness asked me
to figure out a way

508
00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:26.320
to get Princess Hua out of here.

509
00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:27.250
He wants to personally

510
00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:28.320
deal with the second prince of Jinpo.

511
00:26:28.450 --> 00:26:29.730
Please help me.

512
00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:31.970
Why should I?

513
00:26:32.890 --> 00:26:34.040
Yuan Wei,

514
00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:34.930
you're the best.

515
00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:38.010
Please.

516
00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:40.280
Please.

517
00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:40.840
I'm really begging you.

518
00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:47.840
Miss!

519
00:26:48.170 --> 00:26:49.250
Bad news!

520
00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:50.120
Bad news!

521
00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:51.170
What's wrong?

522
00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:52.210
Madam is in a relapse!

523
00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:53.450
She needs you!

524
00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:54.010
What?

525
00:26:54.410 --> 00:26:55.170
Stop asking.

526
00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:55.890
Let's go.

527
00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:57.280
Hurry up!

528
00:27:07.930 --> 00:27:08.730
Second Prince,

529
00:27:09.890 --> 00:27:10.650
I advise you

530
00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:12.690
to return to Jinpo as soon as possible.

531
00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:18.600
For your information, Your Highness,

532
00:27:19.930 --> 00:27:22.010
Princess Hua and I

533
00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:25.930
indeed had a very deep relationship.

534
00:27:29.890 --> 00:27:33.560
She used to

535
00:27:33.650 --> 00:27:35.730
like me very much.

536
00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:38.320
Second Prince,

537
00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:41.600
there're just the two of us now.

538
00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:46.320
You'd better behave yourself.

539
00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:51.210
Anyway,

540
00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:58.600
I'm in for any type of liquor.

541
00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:11.250
Do we continue?

542
00:28:13.890 --> 00:28:18.560
I can still drink for
another 300 rounds.

543
00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:24.760
As the crown prince of the State of Jin,

544
00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:27.600
300 rounds are nothing to me.

545
00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:31.320
I can do at least another 800 rounds.

546
00:28:31.450 --> 00:28:32.490
Cheers.

547
00:28:48.170 --> 00:28:49.210
Watch out, Your Highness.

548
00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:50.560
Jihuai,

549
00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:53.970
take me to see Yun Han.

550
00:28:54.690 --> 00:28:55.410
Sure.

551
00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:06.890
He's seeing that person
while he's drunk.

552
00:29:20.970 --> 00:29:21.840
Take it down.

553
00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:25.080
What are you doing?

554
00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:26.100
(The youngest daughter
of the Hua family, Hua Liuli)

555
00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:27.170
I thought you asked me to take it down.

556
00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:34.040
Hey,

557
00:29:34.210 --> 00:29:35.650
why did you display
their portraits together?

558
00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:36.760
What a coincidence.

559
00:29:37.210 --> 00:29:38.650
The envoys of Jinpo

560
00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:39.840
have come to the capital

561
00:29:39.890 --> 00:29:41.650
and spread an interesting rumour.

562
00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:43.320
Do you want the details, Your Highness?

563
00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:44.450
Sure!

564
00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:45.280
What is it about?

565
00:29:47.210 --> 00:29:48.800
It's about the past

566
00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:50.360
between Second Prince of Jinpo

567
00:29:50.490 --> 00:29:51.800
and Princess Hua.

568
00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:54.010
Princess Hua and He Yuanting…

569
00:29:54.890 --> 00:29:56.210
Don't you understand?

570
00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:58.930
Don't you want to know more about it?

571
00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:07.280
I just want to know if

572
00:30:08.170 --> 00:30:09.730
Princess Hua is a traitor
to the State of Jin.

573
00:30:09.890 --> 00:30:11.690
Also, whether she's seduced
by He Yuanting's good looks.

574
00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:13.890
Let me tell you what happened.

575
00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:16.760
A few months ago.

576
00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:20.730
Greetings, Your Highness.

577
00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:22.280
May I know why

578
00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:23.040
you sent for me?

579
00:30:23.250 --> 00:30:24.210
General A'Wa.

580
00:30:24.890 --> 00:30:26.040
Good timing.

581
00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:28.450
I have something to tell you.

582
00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:29.210
What is it?

583
00:30:29.410 --> 00:30:30.730
A good idea crossed my mind.

584
00:30:30.890 --> 00:30:31.730
What sort of good idea?

585
00:30:33.170 --> 00:30:34.360
Winter is coming soon.

586
00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:36.080
With all the thick snow,

587
00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:37.080
extending the battle line

588
00:30:37.250 --> 00:30:38.840
will only exhaust the people
and waste money.

589
00:30:40.170 --> 00:30:41.840
If not mistaken,

590
00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:43.840
both Jinpo and the State of Jin

591
00:30:44.010 --> 00:30:44.930
wish to end the battle

592
00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:46.080
soonest possible.

593
00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:48.170
I've also found out that

594
00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:50.250
the youngest daughter of the Hua family

595
00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:52.210
is the only offspring

596
00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:53.560
that doesn't go to the battlefield.

597
00:30:54.970 --> 00:30:56.040
I think we can

598
00:30:56.210 --> 00:30:59.040
take advantage of her.

599
00:30:59.210 --> 00:31:00.730
You personally want to take
advantage of her, don't you?

600
00:31:01.730 --> 00:31:02.840
General A'Wa,

601
00:31:03.210 --> 00:31:05.040
let's see how I'm going to outwit

602
00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:06.970
the youngest daughter of the Hua family.

603
00:31:06.970 --> 00:31:07.820
(Hua Liuli)

604
00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:09.500
(Fashionable Gilded Hair Stick)

605
00:31:09.890 --> 00:31:12.080
"Mix red, yellow and brown…"

606
00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:20.730
Look into the mirror.

607
00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:24.970
Miss,

608
00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:26.760
do I really look beautiful?

609
00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:29.040
This is a make-up style
from the capital.

610
00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:30.690
It certainly makes you look beautiful.

611
00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:32.890
Why don't you try it yourself?

612
00:31:33.170 --> 00:31:33.800
I…

613
00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:36.320
I'm practising first.

614
00:31:37.010 --> 00:31:37.360
How about

615
00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:38.930
going out later

616
00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:40.450
to get some comments

617
00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:41.600
from other people?

618
00:31:41.890 --> 00:31:42.600
Let's go.

619
00:31:42.890 --> 00:31:44.410
Will they laugh at me?

620
00:31:44.490 --> 00:31:45.450
When is our turn?

621
00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:46.360
Please show me kindness.

622
00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:48.210
Please give me more.

623
00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:49.170
Move now.

624
00:31:52.690 --> 00:31:53.520
More, please.

625
00:31:53.690 --> 00:31:54.320
There're too many people.

626
00:31:54.650 --> 00:31:55.760
There's only so little
for so many of you.

627
00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:56.650
Move it!

628
00:31:56.730 --> 00:31:57.450
When will it

629
00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:58.730
be our turn?

630
00:32:10.210 --> 00:32:12.690
(I'll be a businessman in disguise)

631
00:32:12.890 --> 00:32:14.360
(and infiltrate Qinghan Prefecture.)

632
00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:15.730
(I'll trick her)

633
00:32:15.930 --> 00:32:17.970
(into travelling to Jinpo.)

634
00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:19.690
(By creating this hindrance,)

635
00:32:19.970 --> 00:32:21.450
(Hua Army is not to be feared.)

636
00:32:21.450 --> 00:32:22.690
She's so beautiful!

637
00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:24.410
She looks beautiful today!

638
00:32:24.490 --> 00:32:25.970
Miss, everyone is staring at me.

639
00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:27.410
Do I look ugly?

640
00:32:27.490 --> 00:32:28.490
You look beautiful.

641
00:32:29.730 --> 00:32:30.840
Take a look!

642
00:32:30.930 --> 00:32:32.010
Princess Hua, the onions are for you.

643
00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:32.760
Thanks.

644
00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:33.840
Princess Hua, here's bread for you.

645
00:32:33.970 --> 00:32:34.690
Thanks.

646
00:32:34.730 --> 00:32:35.560
Princess Hua, this is for you.

647
00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:35.800
Thanks.

648
00:32:35.890 --> 00:32:36.730
She's so different from us.

649
00:32:37.170 --> 00:32:37.890
She's good-looking.

650
00:32:37.970 --> 00:32:38.800
Liuli!

651
00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:39.650
Come here!

652
00:32:39.730 --> 00:32:40.010
Look!

653
00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:41.280
Look at the interesting stuff here.

654
00:32:41.410 --> 00:32:42.600
Look! Come here!

655
00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:43.210
Look!

656
00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:45.250
Come on!

657
00:33:03.210 --> 00:33:03.730
Let's go.

658
00:33:04.970 --> 00:33:05.600
Hurry up!

659
00:33:09.250 --> 00:33:10.170
What's this?

660
00:33:10.410 --> 00:33:11.210
I have it, too.

661
00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:12.730
Look.

662
00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:16.040
Miss Liuli,

663
00:33:16.450 --> 00:33:18.210
are you shy?

664
00:33:18.490 --> 00:33:19.280
Why don't you have a look

665
00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:20.280
at my goods?

666
00:33:25.650 --> 00:33:26.450
Miss Liuli,

667
00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:29.840
you have such gentle temperament

668
00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:31.360
that's rare in this world.

669
00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:33.080
Let me present the flower to you.

670
00:33:33.970 --> 00:33:35.760
Who are you calling "Miss'?

671
00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:39.170
Is he crazy?

672
00:33:39.410 --> 00:33:40.250
He must be visiting
Qinghan Prefecture for the first time.

673
00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:40.930
Exactly.

674
00:33:43.490 --> 00:33:44.210
Liuli,

675
00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:46.280
this guy

676
00:33:46.650 --> 00:33:48.600
looks smart,

677
00:33:48.690 --> 00:33:50.360
but why does he behave stupidly?

678
00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:52.520
We shouldn't judge a book
by its cover indeed.

679
00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:54.250
I'm better than him.

680
00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:55.410
All right.

681
00:33:56.170 --> 00:33:57.450
Liuli?

682
00:34:10.370 --> 00:34:12.640
I acted rudely.

683
00:34:12.810 --> 00:34:13.770
To express my apology,

684
00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:14.770
I'd like to offer

685
00:34:14.930 --> 00:34:16.240
all these items to you.

686
00:34:26.490 --> 00:34:27.680
May I have that?

687
00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:31.720
Of course!

688
00:34:34.770 --> 00:34:35.970
You're forgiven then.

689
00:34:36.850 --> 00:34:38.040
(He Yuanting decided)

690
00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:39.810
(to stay in Qinghan Prefecture
for a few more days,)

691
00:34:40.010 --> 00:34:42.160
(trying to interact with Princess Hua.)

692
00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:44.010
(Finally, one night…)

693
00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:45.850
Liuli, walk slowly.

694
00:34:45.890 --> 00:34:46.720
Mind your step.

695
00:34:46.850 --> 00:34:47.930
He Ming,

696
00:34:48.770 --> 00:34:51.010
it's not even dawn yet.

697
00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:52.640
Why did you bring me here?

698
00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:53.490
What are we doing here?

699
00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:55.410
There's scenery that's only
available at this moment.

700
00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:57.200
You can't enjoy it if
you're lazy to get up.

701
00:34:57.850 --> 00:34:58.450
All right.

702
00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:00.160
You're always right.

703
00:35:02.410 --> 00:35:03.410
However,

704
00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:07.200
there's nothing here.

705
00:35:09.010 --> 00:35:10.560
We shall wait for a bit.

706
00:35:10.810 --> 00:35:11.680
Sit down.

707
00:35:12.850 --> 00:35:13.600
Okay.

708
00:35:26.370 --> 00:35:27.850
I'm hungry.

709
00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:31.200
I brought you here for the view.

710
00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:32.520
As for great food,

711
00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:33.850
we'll have a meal after this.

712
00:35:41.010 --> 00:35:42.040
We'll be done soon.

713
00:35:46.290 --> 00:35:46.770
Here.

714
00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:47.970
Thanks.

715
00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:50.330
He Ming,

716
00:35:50.370 --> 00:35:51.240
you're a nice person.

717
00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:56.810
What a shame,

718
00:35:57.930 --> 00:35:59.680
you're from Jinpo.

719
00:36:02.930 --> 00:36:05.810
Despite the battle between our states,

720
00:36:07.890 --> 00:36:09.160
there're always

721
00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:10.810
people who want peace.

722
00:36:11.290 --> 00:36:12.200
Do you believe that?

723
00:36:12.810 --> 00:36:13.970
I do.

724
00:36:15.330 --> 00:36:16.330
However,

725
00:36:16.810 --> 00:36:18.330
isn't it true that Jinpo

726
00:36:18.410 --> 00:36:19.120
has been trying to conquer

727
00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:20.490
the land of the State of Jin?

728
00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:22.770
That's why the State of Jin
is trying to fight back,

729
00:36:22.850 --> 00:36:23.290
triggering

730
00:36:23.370 --> 00:36:24.850
a long battle, right?

731
00:36:26.810 --> 00:36:28.970
(I'm sorry, Liuli.)

732
00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:32.810
Ordinary civilians like me

733
00:36:33.290 --> 00:36:34.680
can only pray for the battle

734
00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:35.600
to end soonest possible,

735
00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:38.970
no matter

736
00:36:39.010 --> 00:36:40.120
what it takes.

737
00:36:50.450 --> 00:36:51.120
Look!

738
00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:55.520
It's so beautiful!

739
00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:56.370
Look over there!

740
00:36:57.770 --> 00:36:58.490
Watch out!

741
00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:06.770
Thank you, He Ming.

742
00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:18.600
My father says that

743
00:37:18.810 --> 00:37:20.520
after the first snow,

744
00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:22.930
the battle will conclude.

745
00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:30.680
He Ming,

746
00:37:31.970 --> 00:37:33.160
if the State of Jin loses,

747
00:37:35.370 --> 00:37:37.080
will I be captured?

748
00:37:41.370 --> 00:37:42.080
Liuli,

749
00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:45.520
let me take you to Jinpo.

750
00:37:46.450 --> 00:37:47.450
I promise you that

751
00:37:47.930 --> 00:37:49.810
I'll protect you, no matter what.

752
00:37:51.370 --> 00:37:52.560
However, right now

753
00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:54.680
the roads between the two
states have been barricaded,

754
00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:57.680
and what's more, you can't possibly

755
00:37:59.290 --> 00:38:00.890
take me with you because of my status.

756
00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:01.970
I can.

757
00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:03.890
I'll take you there

758
00:38:04.010 --> 00:38:05.560
just like how I came.

759
00:38:08.010 --> 00:38:09.040
Liuli,

760
00:38:09.770 --> 00:38:11.040
let me get prepared.

761
00:38:11.770 --> 00:38:12.890
After three days,

762
00:38:13.810 --> 00:38:14.640
we'll leave.

763
00:38:22.290 --> 00:38:23.370
He Ming,

764
00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:25.560
are we on the right track?

765
00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:27.720
Once we've arrived in
the State of Nanzhao,

766
00:38:27.850 --> 00:38:29.080
we can use the secret passage there

767
00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:30.520
to go to Jinpo.

768
00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:33.330
Let's go.

769
00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:42.580
(Jinpo Border)

770
00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:52.240
Guards,

771
00:38:52.410 --> 00:38:54.010
capture Hua Liuli!

772
00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:54.850
Stop, General.

773
00:38:54.930 --> 00:38:56.810
What do you mean, Your Highness?

774
00:38:57.680 --> 00:38:58.970
Regarding Hua Liuli,

775
00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:00.600
we need to restrategise.

776
00:39:00.890 --> 00:39:01.370
You…

777
00:39:03.890 --> 00:39:05.720
So you're Second Prince from Jinpo?

778
00:39:07.890 --> 00:39:08.560
Liuli,

779
00:39:09.410 --> 00:39:11.240
besides the fact that
I'm the second prince,

780
00:39:11.410 --> 00:39:13.240
I've never lied to you.

781
00:39:16.490 --> 00:39:18.080
What are you going to do to me?

782
00:39:18.890 --> 00:39:19.850
I've promised you

783
00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:21.120
that I'll protect you.

784
00:39:21.330 --> 00:39:22.120
What are you talking about?

785
00:39:22.330 --> 00:39:23.330
Capture her now!

786
00:39:23.490 --> 00:39:24.370
She'll be used

787
00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:25.680
in our negotiations with the Hua family.

788
00:39:25.850 --> 00:39:26.970
General A'Wa,

789
00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:29.160
we've been besieged by Jin's army!

790
00:39:29.290 --> 00:39:29.850
Your Highness,

791
00:39:29.930 --> 00:39:30.850
keep an eye on Hua Liuli.

792
00:39:30.970 --> 00:39:31.560
I'll check the situation.

793
00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:33.930
Liuli, let's go.

794
00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:40.450
He Yuanting,

795
00:39:40.930 --> 00:39:41.640
our show has come

796
00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:42.290
to an end here.

797
00:39:42.370 --> 00:39:43.120
When did you

798
00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:44.160
find out the truth?

799
00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:46.490
All sorts of people mingle
in Qinghan Prefecture.

800
00:39:46.930 --> 00:39:48.160
You only have yourself to blame

801
00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:49.930
because of your conspicuous appearance.

802
00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:51.010
People became suspicious

803
00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:52.200
and ran a background check on you.

804
00:39:52.930 --> 00:39:53.770
You lied to me.

805
00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:55.240
Didn't you lie to me?

806
00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:58.080
I grew up near the border.

807
00:39:58.410 --> 00:40:00.160
The most intense things I've seen

808
00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:02.120
were the flags stained

809
00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:03.450
with Jin soldiers' blood!

810
00:40:04.450 --> 00:40:06.490
If you intend to use me to hold
the Hua family to ransom,

811
00:40:06.970 --> 00:40:08.330
it just goes to prove
that you're too naïve.

812
00:40:08.450 --> 00:40:10.010
Everything you say and do

813
00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:11.010
is just for show.

814
00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:13.410
So, don't expect me to be sincere.

815
00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:16.410
He Yuanting's plan has failed.

816
00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:18.160
He even walked straight
into Princess Hua's trap.

817
00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:20.640
If not for A'Wa,

818
00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:22.040
he could've been

819
00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:23.040
seized by Jin's army.

820
00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:23.930
I knew…

821
00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:25.010
I knew there was something

822
00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:26.120
between Princess Hua and He Yuanting!

823
00:40:26.810 --> 00:40:27.810
Pei,

824
00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:30.290
the Crown prince has taken

825
00:40:30.410 --> 00:40:31.370
a liking to Princess Hua.

826
00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:33.200
- Since when?
- Since when?

827
00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:35.040
Have I?

828
00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:37.600
Judging by my standards,

829
00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:38.890
how could I have fallen for her?

830
00:40:42.770 --> 00:40:43.560
Indeed.

831
00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:45.520
Princess Hua is a weak lady

832
00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:46.720
who hails from the frontier.

833
00:40:46.970 --> 00:40:48.240
She behaves strangely

834
00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:50.120
and even starts gossips in the capital.

835
00:40:50.410 --> 00:40:51.120
She really doesn't deserve you,

836
00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:52.120
Your Highness.

837
00:40:52.970 --> 00:40:53.850
Your words

838
00:40:53.890 --> 00:40:54.600
are unpleasant.

839
00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:56.240
Who doesn't deserve Princess Hua?

840
00:40:58.850 --> 00:41:01.010
Your Highness, you used to be
arrogant and you prefer solitude.

841
00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:02.370
You would never be touched by anyone.

842
00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:04.410
However, after

843
00:41:04.490 --> 00:41:05.850
being attracted by Princess Hua,

844
00:41:06.490 --> 00:41:08.290
you keep eyeing her

845
00:41:08.490 --> 00:41:09.410
wherever she goes.

846
00:41:10.970 --> 00:41:12.770
However, since the second prince
of Jinpo came,

847
00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:14.120
you haven't reacted.

848
00:41:15.490 --> 00:41:16.370
I know what it is.

849
00:41:17.010 --> 00:41:18.120
It's like

850
00:41:18.370 --> 00:41:19.930
feeling threatened.

851
00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:32.850
I've thought about

852
00:41:33.370 --> 00:41:34.490
meeting Princess Hua

853
00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:37.080
to express what I think.

854
00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:39.560
However, I have to plan carefully.

855
00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:42.040
I mustn't take it lightly.

856
00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:46.930
Why am I always the victim?

857
00:41:59.370 --> 00:42:01.970
If I had not met the second prince

858
00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:03.410
of Jinpo today,

859
00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:05.600
I wouldn't have realised that

860
00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:07.490
you'd been doing so many things

861
00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:09.200
behind my back.

862
00:42:09.490 --> 00:42:10.850
The second prince suggested

863
00:42:10.890 --> 00:42:11.850
cooperating with me and had me

864
00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:13.520
lured to the forest.

865
00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:15.600
However, his real reason was that

866
00:42:15.810 --> 00:42:16.850
he knew about our rebellion

867
00:42:16.890 --> 00:42:18.010
against the State of Jin

868
00:42:18.490 --> 00:42:19.520
during the battle

869
00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:20.410
ten years ago.

870
00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:23.040
I don't think it was

871
00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:24.080
an invitation to cooperate with us,

872
00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:25.560
but a threat.

873
00:42:25.930 --> 00:42:27.040
So, are you saying that

874
00:42:27.330 --> 00:42:28.890
your rejection was

875
00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:30.850
for our sake?

876
00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:31.640
Of course.

877
00:42:31.930 --> 00:42:34.720
How did Qing Yue end up dead?

878
00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:37.080
After being wounded by

879
00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:38.040
the second prince of Jinpo,

880
00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:40.080
I spent some time recuperating.

881
00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:41.600
Qing Yue was

882
00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:42.410
killed suddenly

883
00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:43.970
at the time.

884
00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:47.640
If I had betrayed you

885
00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:48.770
as claimed by

886
00:42:48.890 --> 00:42:49.970
the second prince,

887
00:42:50.010 --> 00:42:51.200
why would your background

888
00:42:51.490 --> 00:42:53.290
have remained hidden, master?

889
00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:09.940
(Pretentious Hour)

890
00:43:10.290 --> 00:43:11.080
Your Highness.

891
00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:15.600
Your Highness,

892
00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:17.410
save me.

893
00:43:17.450 --> 00:43:19.560
I don't want to study.

894
00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:22.520
Just talk.

895
00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:24.640
Don't touch me.

896
00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:32.290
Isn't it good to study?

897
00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:35.450
I think it is.

898
00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:37.290
However,

899
00:43:37.850 --> 00:43:39.010
since I was little,

900
00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:40.450
I have never been studious.

901
00:43:41.930 --> 00:43:43.490
Think about this.

902
00:43:44.010 --> 00:43:45.040
You must win the admiration

903
00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:47.080
of the State of Jin's crown prince.

904
00:43:47.450 --> 00:43:50.010
How could you not study well?

905
00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:57.720
Can't my beauty

906
00:43:57.810 --> 00:43:59.490
win his heart?

907
00:44:02.450 --> 00:44:03.080
Tell Wen Zhe

908
00:44:04.450 --> 00:44:06.160
to bring what you've learnt today

909
00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:07.160
here.

910
00:44:07.290 --> 00:44:08.640
