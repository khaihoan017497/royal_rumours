Report anyone

21
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:47.830
suspicious.

22
00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:58.390
Untie them.

23
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:05.000
Come.

24
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.030
Where do you want to bring us?

25
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.470
Get up.

26
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.910
Come on.

27
00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:08.110
Move.

28
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.640
I...

29
00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:09.480
Move now.

30
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.040
Brother.

31
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:14.390
Roads to all prefectures

32
00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.040
are already guarded by soldiers.

33
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.550
We may not be able to get out.

34
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.830
Then...

35
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.640
Why don't we cut their faces

36
00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.040
then dress up in disguise?

37
00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:26.640
Doesn't cutting their faces now

38
00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.150
tell others explicitly

39
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.150
that there's a problem with their face?

40
00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.780
(Righteous Radiance)

41
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.990
Your Highness.

42
00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.150
Your Highness.

43
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.870
There's news about Princess Hua.

44
00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:05.430
Hao'er.

45
00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:08.360
Mother.

46
00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.200
Where are you going?

47
00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:11.520
I hear

48
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:12.670
that Princess Hua and Princess Jiamin

49
00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:13.480
have gone missing.

50
00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:15.590
Your father got angry at the court.

51
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.150
He let the Crown Prince investigate the matter.

52
00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.760
Don't wade into this mess.

53
00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:19.670
If they're found,

54
00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:20.830
that's the Crown Prince's credit.

55
00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:21.830
If not,

56
00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:22.830
you'll get into trouble

57
00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:23.920
again.

58
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:24.920
Mother.

59
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:26.360
Let's not mention that Princess Hua

60
00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:27.920
is my betrothed wife.

61
00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:29.360
Princess Jiamin is also a close friend

62
00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:30.760
of mine.

63
00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.640
The competition of the Ceremonial Officer.

64
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.080
I wouldn't have held up

65
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.990
for so long if without

66
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.040
Princess Jiamin.

67
00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:37.760
So I must look into this matter.

68
00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.800
Hao'er, you mustn't force yourself
in everything.

69
00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.240
Has she really gone missing

70
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.320
with Princess Hua?

71
00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:46.710
Yes.

72
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:47.590
Princess' bangle

73
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:48.670
was discovered at where Princess Hua

74
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:49.590
went missing.

75
00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:52.830
What did you hear at the court assembly?

76
00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:53.670
Didn't you even know that your daughter

77
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:54.550
had gone missing?

78
00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.920
Aren't you the same?

79
00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.150
She'll be fine.

80
00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:00.390
- I let Minmin learn from
- Let me see.

81
00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.480
Wei Mingyue since young.

82
00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:02.870
She's practised martial arts for years.

83
00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:04.430
She'll be fine.

84
00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.390
Right.

85
00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.710
She'll be fine.

86
00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:07.550
What is right?

87
00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:08.920
Go to find her already.

88
00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.320
Go.

89
00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.830
Sure.

90
00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.590
Don't worry.

91
00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:12.760
- I'm going now.
- Go.

92
00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:13.550
Sure.

93
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.120
Charcoal fire has been deliberately cleared.

94
00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.080
No blood stain found in the house.

95
00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:33.880
No traces of combat either.

96
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.000
The column

97
00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.760
has marks of rope binding.

98
00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.590
It seems that their lives aren't
threatened for now.

99
00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:58.120
Why are you

100
00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.350
also here?

101
00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.200
Why can't I find a place

102
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:03.880
where you get to find?

103
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.830
Who do you come to find?

104
00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.470
Princess Jiamin and Princess Hua for sure.

105
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:09.760
I'm just like you.

106
00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:12.270
I'm different from you.

107
00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:14.910
I'm searching for

108
00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:16.680
Princess Hua and Princess Jiamin.

109
00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.200
What makes the difference?

110
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.830
Are you sure it's here?

111
00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.880
Your Highness.

112
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.440
We discovered ruts of a carriage outside.

113
00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:35.560
It's south-bound.

114
00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:37.350
Why don't we

115
00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:38.390
split into two ways?

116
00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:40.000
You go following the ruts,

117
00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.030
straight to Nan Prefecture.

118
00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:42.590
I take another direction

119
00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:43.590
to Shanling Prefecture.

120
00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:46.000
All right.

121
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:47.200
I'll

122
00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:48.560
bring both princesses back.

123
00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:49.790
I'm going now.

124
00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.960
Your Highness.

125
00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:57.350
Are we really going to Shanling Prefecture?

126
00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.640
Take elite Blackmail Troop

127
00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:01.150
to Shanling Prefecture.

128
00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.200
As for Prince Ying...

129
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:04.320
He won't encounter the assassins

130
00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.590
in Nan Prefecture.

131
00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:07.680
He'll be safer there.

132
00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:09.830
I don't want him harmed when I have yet

133
00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:12.080
to find both princesses.

134
00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:13.760
Noted.

135
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:16.200
Your Highness.

136
00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:17.910
Your Highness.

137
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:19.270
Mister has sent in a report.

138
00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:20.390
Almost half of the moles

139
00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:21.560
in the capital have been exposed.

140
00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:26.460
(Shanling Prefecture)
Let me see.

141
00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:27.340
(Shanling Prefecture)
They're clothes.

142
00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:27.910
Pass.

143
00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:29.270
- What's this?
- Come.

144
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:29.760
Turn around.

145
00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:31.300
Come.

146
00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:32.640
All right, pass. Next.

147
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:45.710
What do you want now?

148
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.080
Brother and I

149
00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.350
are only in charge of
sending you off the mountain.

150
00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:49.470
I won't bother

151
00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:50.560
what they'd do

152
00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:51.830
to you.

153
00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:53.960
Sister.

154
00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:55.790
Aren't you coming with us?

155
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.120
Don't call me sister.

156
00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:59.320
And don't blame us.

157
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:01.830
Brother and I

158
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:03.640
will be freed after this.

159
00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:05.560
Will you go back

160
00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:06.640
to live with your family

161
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:08.120
in Longxi after you're freed?

162
00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:09.640
How do you know

163
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:10.470
where I'm from?

164
00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.790
Don't be nervous.

165
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.030
I'm just guessing.

166
00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:16.680
You speak

167
00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:18.470
with some Longxi accents.

168
00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:21.560
What are you trying to say?

169
00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:23.960
I'm just thinking

170
00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.200
if you can really

171
00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:27.830
start a new life.

172
00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.270
When I can guess

173
00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:31.230
that you come from Longxi,

174
00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:32.960
don't the people who hire you

175
00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:35.000
know the same?

176
00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.200
Will they set you free

177
00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:37.520
so easily?

178
00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.030
What do you want?

179
00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:41.680
I just care about you.

180
00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:43.520
Moreover,

181
00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:45.760
I'm unwell.

182
00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:48.120
I'm worried that I'd cough blood

183
00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:49.320
then stain

184
00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:51.320
the dress.

185
00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:52.830
Enough.

186
00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:53.880
You won't get to escape

187
00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:54.910
even if I let you go.

188
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.350
I have no mean to escape.

189
00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:57.830
I won't get to escape

190
00:07:57.910 --> 00:07:59.150
in my health condition.

191
00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:01.120
All right.

192
00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:10.960
Sister.

193
00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:12.270
Take this.

194
00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:13.790
This tablet

195
00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:14.960
can at least secure

196
00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:15.880
your living.

197
00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:24.640
What's wrong? Are you okay?

198
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:26.910
I'm okay. It's an old disease.

199
00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:28.000
You...

200
00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:29.470
Why do you want to help me?

201
00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:31.470
I should repay you

202
00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:32.750
for the meat slices.

203
00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.160
Moreover,

204
00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:35.110
you knew

205
00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:36.320
I'm Hua Liuli, right?

206
00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:38.830
And you've been showing mercy.

207
00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:39.830
I believe

208
00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:41.680
you have your own difficulty.

209
00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:44.750
Tie me up.

210
00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:47.960
(Hua Liuli.)

211
00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:49.960
(Are you out of your mind?)

212
00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:57.830
Look after yourself.

213
00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.200
Brother and I will leave now.

214
00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.320
Take care, sister.

215
00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:09.080
Why did she give this to me?

216
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:12.560
Maybe you seemed stronger.

217
00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.200
Come down.

218
00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:34.830
Do you want me

219
00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:36.280
to carry you down instead?

220
00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:39.630
Be quick.

221
00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:42.750
Come down.

222
00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.440
Don't touch me.

223
00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:46.920
Come down already.

224
00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:48.400
Do you really want him to carry you down?

225
00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:52.750
Come on.

226
00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:54.710
Move.

227
00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:56.200
Cheers.

228
00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:56.960
- Come on.
- Drink.

229
00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:57.560
- Drink.
- Cheers.

230
00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:00.080
Cheers.

231
00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:02.750
Give it to me.

232
00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:03.960
What?

233
00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:05.110
- Have some.
- Come on.

234
00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:07.590
Come.

235
00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:08.750
Cheers.

236
00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:09.960
Bottoms up.

237
00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:14.320
Fill it up.

238
00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:30.230
Come on.

239
00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:32.350
Call me brother.

240
00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:34.080
I give you something delicious.

241
00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:37.960
Look at the two of them.

242
00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:39.470
They're noblewomen.

243
00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:40.630
So what?

244
00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:41.590
At this time,

245
00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:43.440
they're obedient like dogs.

246
00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:44.830
Listen.

247
00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:46.230
My parents are searching for us.

248
00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:47.470
You won't get away.

249
00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:48.830
Why do we want to get away?

250
00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:50.470
Although we aren't allowed to kill you,

251
00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:52.630
we may do

252
00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:54.200
something else.

253
00:10:56.830 --> 00:10:58.470
Go away!

254
00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:00.200
- Come on.
- Go away!

255
00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:01.230
Go away!

256
00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:02.080
Come on.

257
00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:04.110
Go away!

258
00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:04.990
Where do you think you can go?

259
00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:06.710
Go away!

260
00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:15.630
Your Highness.

261
00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:17.560
We've thoroughly investigated the entries

262
00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:18.710
of Shanling Prefecture in two days.

263
00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:20.200
There's no one

264
00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:20.920
like Princess Hua

265
00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:22.230
and Princess Jiamin.

266
00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:23.590
Why don't we

267
00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:24.990
change the direction?

268
00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:30.400
If they want to leave the capital the soonest,

269
00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:32.960
this should be the easiest route.

270
00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:42.870
It's left by Liuli.

271
00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:44.680
This is the correct route.

272
00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:46.990
It's this direction.

273
00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:47.590
Pursue.

274
00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:51.160
Go away!

275
00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:53.200
(You make me do this.)

276
00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:56.320
Go away!

277
00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:08.320
I always think

278
00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:09.960
that feebleness is a kind of weapon.

279
00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:11.800
But this weapon

280
00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:13.320
is useful to people,

281
00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:15.680
but not beasts.

282
00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:17.510
Stay away.

283
00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:18.800
Watch out for spilled blood.

284
00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:57.350
Hua Liuli, don't kill me.

285
00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:58.680
I don't like Prince Ying.

286
00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:00.040
You're a perfect match for Prince Ying.

287
00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:01.280
You're more than worthy of him.

288
00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:02.560
You're the best beauty in the State of Jin.

289
00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:03.470
Pick any palace as you like.

290
00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:04.440
You bring honour to the Hua's family.

291
00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.960
General Wei is lucky to have a daughter

292
00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:09.040
like you.

293
00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:10.200
I'm wrong.

294
00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:11.510
I dare not do wrong again

295
00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:13.280
to offend you.

296
00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:26.920
Who are you?

297
00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:39.280
He Yuanting.

298
00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:43.710
It's certainly you.

299
00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:45.350
How dare you

300
00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:46.560
appear like this in front of me?

301
00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:48.680
Aren't you afraid that I'd arrest you?

302
00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:50.080
You should also watch out

303
00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:52.230
for the life of your company.

304
00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:55.110
(Why does he come to Jin?)

305
00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.200
Is it you who hire those assassins?

306
00:13:57.230 --> 00:13:58.080
Of course not.

307
00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:01.960
You're the first who locates me

308
00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:03.800
before all others.

309
00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:05.800
Do you come to save me?

310
00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:06.590
Yes.

311
00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:08.990
I came to save you.

312
00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:10.110
After knowing

313
00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:11.830
that you've become the Ceremonial Officer,

314
00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:12.400
I bet

315
00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:14.280
there'd be someone who wanted to

316
00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:16.280
take this chance to frame Jinpo up.

317
00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.350
Jinpo will just do it

318
00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:19.830
if we want to kill you.

319
00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:21.080
There's no need

320
00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:22.080
to spend much effort

321
00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.560
to bring you all the way
to this kind of place.

322
00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:26.440
It does make sense.

323
00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:28.200
I'll be able to recognise you

324
00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:29.200
even if you've been turned into ashes.

325
00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:30.200
My people

326
00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:31.800
will also be able to.

327
00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:34.590
Do you always remember me?

328
00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:38.510
Since you're safe,

329
00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:40.110
I'll leave.

330
00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:42.920
Will you attend the States Assembly?

331
00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:43.710
No.

332
00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:45.870
I'll kill the five dumb

333
00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:47.350
subordinates of yours then.

334
00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:56.680
(I wonder what he wants to do)

335
00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:58.470
(this time.)

336
00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:03.280
I hear nothing.

337
00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:04.110
I see nothing.

338
00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:05.990
I know you feel nothing for Prince Ying

339
00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:07.830
so I won't act against you.

340
00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:14.080
Jiamin.

341
00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:15.960
I was so scared just now.

342
00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:17.040
Thank you

343
00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:19.160
for saving me.

344
00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:21.710
There're many beasts just now.

345
00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:23.710
They've killed all the kidnappers.

346
00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:25.800
It's really scary.

347
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:29.040
You'll always protect me,

348
00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:29.870
right?

349
00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:31.470
(Why didn't I do something else,)

350
00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:32.320
(but I messed)

351
00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:33.800
(with Hua Liuli?)

352
00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.630
(Why?)

353
00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:47.230
I have back pain

354
00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:48.830
from the sleep.

355
00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:50.510
You're up.

356
00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:52.560
Come and make fire.

357
00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:58.920
If I didn't set up this shelter last night,

358
00:15:58.990 --> 00:16:00.590
even if you wouldn't have been bitten
by beasts,

359
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:02.280
you would've been frozen to death.

360
00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:03.830
Right.

361
00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:06.160
I've added herbs to repel insects

362
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:07.830
in your spice bag.

363
00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:09.800
Thank you for the trouble.

364
00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:12.350
Sister.

365
00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:14.400
Don't be so polite to me.

366
00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:17.080
I won't tell

367
00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:18.280
the secret of yesterday.

368
00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:19.350
Even if I do,

369
00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:20.710
no one will believe it.

370
00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:21.470
Secret?

371
00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:23.750
Do I have a secret?

372
00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:25.080
What secret?

373
00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:26.560
Don't get it wrong.

374
00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:28.440
I mean you're certainly

375
00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:29.560
a feeble beauty.

376
00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:31.870
Yes.

377
00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:35.560
So.

378
00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:37.470
Can we leave?

379
00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:39.400
Yes.

380
00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:41.870
But we can't leave any traces.

381
00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:54.440
I suddenly feel very tired.

382
00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:56.710
I may not be able to walk.

383
00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:06.270
Jiamin.

384
00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:08.230
You're really nice.

385
00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:10.070
Not only that you've saved my life,

386
00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:11.270
you care so much about me.

387
00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:23.510
I can't walk anymore.

388
00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:27.790
I'm too weak.

389
00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:29.360
I really can't walk anymore.

390
00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:33.310
The official road was just next to us,

391
00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:34.600
but you refused taking it.

392
00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:36.400
Now you're sitting down.

393
00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:41.470
Do you want to do something?

394
00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:44.310
Do you still dare to take the official road?

395
00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:46.880
Someone transported the two of us

396
00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:47.990
out of the capital

397
00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:49.600
without others knowing.

398
00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:50.550
It means

399
00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:52.200
he's covered up by someone

400
00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:53.550
extraordinary.

401
00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:55.840
If we take the official road at this time,

402
00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:57.160
will the people who we meet

403
00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:58.120
help

404
00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.200
or harm us?

405
00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:04.160
Are you hungry?

406
00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:09.710
Here you go.

407
00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:16.600
Why do you have steamed buns?

408
00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:17.750
Where do you get it from?

409
00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:19.640
It's from the few assassins.

410
00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:29.270
Did you take food from dead bodies?

411
00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:30.710
The people are dead,

412
00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:32.270
but not the steamed buns.

413
00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:33.750
Why is it inedible?

414
00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:36.840
I'm not going to eat it.
I'm not hungry anymore.

415
00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:44.310
I go and find someone to see us back.

416
00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:50.710
Wait a moment.

417
00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:54.990
Mister.

418
00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:57.070
I am

419
00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:58.710
a princess from the capital.

420
00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:00.160
I've fallen into difficulties.

421
00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:01.640
If you send me back,

422
00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:03.160
I let them give you 100 taels of silver.

423
00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:05.230
I'll be a prince

424
00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:06.600
if you're a princess.

425
00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:08.070
What a liar.

426
00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:08.750
Stay away from me.

427
00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:11.400
Why does a girl

428
00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:13.160
want to deceive others?

429
00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:16.120
Me?

430
00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:17.990
Am I a liar?

431
00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:21.400
You're a liar instead,

432
00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:22.120
you know?

433
00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:22.600
You...

434
00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:24.510
You'll regret!

435
00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:27.470
How do I look like a liar?

436
00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:30.960
He called me a liar.

437
00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:32.470
You're so useless.

438
00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:33.510
Hold it.

439
00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:39.400
Wait. What are you doing?

440
00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:41.230
Wait for a carriage.

441
00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:46.310
I'll see how you get one.

442
00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:12.270
Girl, are you okay?

443
00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:16.880
Granny.

444
00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:20.840
My sister and I

445
00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:23.840
haven't eaten for a few days.

446
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:25.550
We're on our way

447
00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:28.160
of seeing our relatives in the capital.

448
00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:29.550
In the middle of the road,

449
00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:32.270
we met a sister

450
00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:35.440
who claimed that she'd bring us
into the city.

451
00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:36.680
In the end,

452
00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:40.030
we realised we're travelling further.

453
00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:42.310
We had a hard time

454
00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:44.600
of escaping.

455
00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:49.120
This is where we are in the end.

456
00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:51.360
We don't even know

457
00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:53.680
where we are.

458
00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:03.880
Well...

459
00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:15.880
- Thank you.
- Thank you, granny.

460
00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:17.070
The two of you

461
00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:18.440
are too naive.

462
00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:19.470
Hasn't it crossed your mind

463
00:21:19.550 --> 00:21:20.680
that me and my husband

464
00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:21.840
could also be swindlers?

465
00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:22.920
No,

466
00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:24.840
but I think you're good people.

467
00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:29.470
It's for our daughter.

468
00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:30.550
We'll sell more mountain goods

469
00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:31.960
in the city.

470
00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:33.030
Here you go.

471
00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:34.510
- Thank you, granny.
- Thank you, granny.

472
00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:35.840
Granny.

473
00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:37.440
Are you going to sell your goods in the city?

474
00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:38.310
Yes.

475
00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:39.470
We've won the battle.

476
00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:40.790
The benevolent Emperor

477
00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:42.200
has reduced the tax.

478
00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:43.440
The life

479
00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:45.070
is better than before.

480
00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:46.640
We want some money for household expenses

481
00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:47.990
then buy a new dress

482
00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:49.400
for our daughter.

483
00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:52.960
Don't worry.

484
00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:54.750
There'll be no more war.

485
00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:56.400
The day will get better.

486
00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:12.060
(Shanling Prefecture)

487
00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:14.360
Let me inspect.

488
00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:18.030
Enter.

489
00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:23.440
There're so many soldiers.

490
00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:25.510
It seems like they're inspecting people.

491
00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:27.030
I wonder what's going on.

492
00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:29.120
Crown Prince.

493
00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:30.640
It's the Crown Prince.

494
00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:31.470
Crown Prince...

495
00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:32.790
Don't shout.

496
00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:33.960
We both are in a mess.

497
00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:35.200
We'll cause ill luck to him.

498
00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:36.710
He has a scary temper.

499
00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:41.750
Crown Prince!

500
00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:45.790
Crown Prince!

501
00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:49.360
Princess Hua!

502
00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:54.310
- Hua Liuli.
- Come on.

503
00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:55.400
Be careful.

504
00:23:48.030 --> 00:23:48.750
Your Highness.

505
00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:52.070
It's good to see you again.

506
00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:54.270
Me too.

507
00:23:57.310 --> 00:23:58.400
(My goodness!)

508
00:23:58.550 --> 00:24:00.510
(How many secrets have I known?)

509
00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:03.230
(Will I be able to live on?)

510
00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:05.600
Your Highness.

511
00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:08.400
You're suffocating me.

512
00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:13.360
Your Highness.

513
00:24:13.470 --> 00:24:14.920
Do you come to find us?

514
00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:16.230
No.

515
00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:19.510
Yes.

516
00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:25.070
Are you hurt?

517
00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:27.030
No.

518
00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:42.470
Your Highness.

519
00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:44.030
Can you

520
00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:46.030
not rub my head?

521
00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:48.200
I haven't bathed

522
00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:49.400
for three days.

523
00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:51.440
My head is covered with dirt.

524
00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:52.200
It's very dirty.

525
00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:53.070
I don't think so.

526
00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:57.710
Princess Hua.

527
00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:00.030
Let's get in a carriage.

528
00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:03.750
Right. There's Jiamin.

529
00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:05.880
Princess Jiamin.

530
00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:07.310
Are you okay?

531
00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:08.470
Your Highness.

532
00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:09.790
I'm okay.

533
00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:11.710
Your Highness.

534
00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:13.510
You almost couldn't see us anymore.

535
00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:15.640
Those kidnappers were so fierce.

536
00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:17.790
They scared the hell out of me.

537
00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:19.880
And there're beasts in the mountain.

538
00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:20.790
The beasts

539
00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:22.440
fought with those kidnappers

540
00:25:22.550 --> 00:25:24.400
then bit all of them to death.

541
00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:26.360
Thanks to Jiamin.

542
00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:28.470
She saved me.

543
00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:29.270
Otherwise,

544
00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:31.270
I wouldn't have been able to see my parents.

545
00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:32.270
Not to mention

546
00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:33.840
seeing you.

547
00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:36.840
You're welcome. It's my honour.

548
00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:38.510
Your Highness.

549
00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:39.550
You don't know

550
00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:41.400
how powerful Jiamin is.

551
00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:42.470
She

552
00:25:42.550 --> 00:25:43.270
made a flip

553
00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:44.440
then stood up instantly.

554
00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:46.270
Then she rapidly pulled a blade beside her

555
00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:47.230
then hacked a giant wolf

556
00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:47.990
that came

557
00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:49.120
towards her.

558
00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:50.070
She instantly hacked

559
00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:51.550
the right eye of the giant wolf.

560
00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:52.990
Then she moved to one side to dodge

561
00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:54.310
the attack of the second giant wolf.

562
00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:56.230
She kicked it away.

563
00:25:56.990 --> 00:25:58.550
Right, Jiamin?

564
00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:00.640
Yes.

565
00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:01.360
That's right.

566
00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:02.600
That's it.

567
00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:04.640
Thank you for helping her escape,

568
00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:05.840
Princess Jiamin.

569
00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:09.030
It's nothing. It's my honour.

570
00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:10.510
Back in the capital,

571
00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:12.310
I have some questions to ask in detail.

572
00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:13.550
Sure.

573
00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:18.070
(Why is it me again?)

574
00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:32.920
Your Highness hasn't slept for a few days.

575
00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:34.160
Do you dare reminding him?

576
00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:35.990
Do you?

577
00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:37.960
I don't.

578
00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:39.270
I don't either.

579
00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:51.990
Can you move over there?

580
00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:53.880
Jiamin.

581
00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:55.360
Stop chatting with me.

582
00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:57.400
I'm very tired.

583
00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:11.880
(Liuli.)

584
00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:13.990
(I won't let you be harmed)

585
00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:14.840
(anymore.)

586
00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:29.960
Your Highness.

587
00:27:31.550 --> 00:27:32.680
Prince Ying.

588
00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:33.920
Let's take a break.

589
00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:34.710
No.

590
00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:37.680
I must find Princess Jiamin

591
00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:39.230
and Princess Hua in person.

592
00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:43.310
(Oh no!)

593
00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:45.880
(I forgot to tell Yuanhao)

594
00:27:46.030 --> 00:27:47.310
(that I've found them.)

595
00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:53.780
(Capital)

596
00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:07.640
What are you looking at?

597
00:28:08.550 --> 00:28:10.310
We've entered the capital.

598
00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:13.400
You've slept for four hours.

599
00:28:17.470 --> 00:28:19.030
My legs are numbed.

600
00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:21.120
(Princess Hua.)

601
00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:22.640
(We've arrived at Hua Mansion.)

602
00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:26.860
(Blossoming Wealth)
Miss!

603
00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:28.260
(Hua Mansion)
Miss!

604
00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:29.300
(Hua Mansion)

605
00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:30.920
Miss, come down now.

606
00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:33.920
You made me worried.

607
00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:35.920
I'm fine.

608
00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:36.880
Wait, Your Highness.

609
00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:37.920
My mansion

610
00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:38.840
is clearly closer.

611
00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:40.200
Why do you come to the western suburb first?

612
00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:41.360
Princess Hua.

613
00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:43.440
Go and rest in your mansion.

614
00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:46.640
I'll bother Princess Jiamin

615
00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:47.750
to make a trip with me to the Supreme Court.

616
00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:49.550
The Supreme Court?

617
00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:50.880
Thank you, Princess Jiamin

618
00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:52.440
for saving me this time.

619
00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:54.680
I'll pay a visit to thank you

620
00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:56.310
after getting well.

621
00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:58.510
Princess Jiamin.

622
00:28:58.990 --> 00:29:00.750
You're strong.

623
00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:02.680
You should cooperate

624
00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:03.990
with His Highness's investigation.

625
00:29:04.510 --> 00:29:06.680
You must know what to say.

626
00:29:06.790 --> 00:29:08.960
I get it.

627
00:29:09.030 --> 00:29:11.030
Go back to rest.

628
00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:13.070
Come on, Miss.

629
00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:14.440
My head hurts.

630
00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:17.360
Why has

631
00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:18.920
Princess Jiamin

632
00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:19.990
changed after a few days?

633
00:29:21.790 --> 00:29:22.880
Have they been found?

634
00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:24.990
Then why hasn't

635
00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:26.510
the Crown Prince sent Minmin back?

636
00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:27.920
His Highness sent someone

637
00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:28.840
to inform us.

638
00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:31.030
He said the princess fought many alone.

639
00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:32.230
She even protected Princess Hua

640
00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:33.440
in the attack of beasts.

641
00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:34.550
She's brave.

642
00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:35.230
However,

643
00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:37.400
the Emperor is angry with the kidnapping

644
00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:38.440
of both princesses.

645
00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:40.640
His Majesty wants princess's
cooperation in the investigation.

646
00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:43.160
Who fought many alone?

647
00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:44.310
Who is brave?

648
00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:45.750
The princess.

649
00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:47.360
She's certainly my daughter.

650
00:29:48.270 --> 00:29:50.230
She's certainly my daughter.

651
00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:51.600
I always

652
00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:53.120
want Minmin

653
00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:55.120
to be like General Wei.

654
00:29:55.790 --> 00:29:58.470
Stand in front of the people in a crisis.

655
00:29:58.920 --> 00:29:59.990
She's made it.

656
00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:01.960
It's for real.

657
00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:03.880
Yes.

658
00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:05.470
Our daughter

659
00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:07.400
protected the daughter of General Wei.

660
00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:09.840
General Wei will thank you

661
00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:12.070
when she comes back.

662
00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:16.100
(Supreme Court)

663
00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:16.960
Princess Jiamin.

664
00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:18.200
Go to see.

665
00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:19.960
Was it these people

666
00:30:20.030 --> 00:30:21.270
who kidnapped you and Princess Hua?

667
00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:23.550
I

668
00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:25.360
don't think it's necessary.

669
00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:31.310
I still want to verify it.

670
00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:23.200
I think so.

671
00:31:25.310 --> 00:31:26.550
I'm surprised that when you're scared

672
00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:28.750
of a few dead bodies,

673
00:31:29.550 --> 00:31:31.470
you actually had the courage to fight

674
00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:33.230
the beasts that bit them to death.

675
00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:47.400
You're so brave

676
00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:49.440
and adept at martial arts.

677
00:31:50.030 --> 00:31:51.440
Princess Shun'an and Minister Tian

678
00:31:51.510 --> 00:31:53.160
must have taught you the right way.

679
00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:55.750
More than a decade of nurturing

680
00:31:56.270 --> 00:31:57.200
allowed you

681
00:31:57.270 --> 00:31:58.680
to save you and Princess Hua

682
00:31:59.030 --> 00:32:00.880
in the time of danger.

683
00:32:02.550 --> 00:32:04.030
I'll

684
00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:06.230
report this to His Majesty.

685
00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:13.310
We must let people in the capital

686
00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:14.200
make a big deal about it

687
00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:15.880
and let the people know

688
00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:17.470
how brave

689
00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:19.960
and fearless Princess Jiamin is.

690
00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:20.710
- Yes.
- Yes.

691
00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:26.920
Please

692
00:32:26.990 --> 00:32:27.960
confirm the details.

693
00:32:57.880 --> 00:32:59.070
Yuan Wei.

694
00:32:59.790 --> 00:33:00.710
Miss.

695
00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:02.270
You're up at last.

696
00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:03.640
The Crown Prince has spent half a day

697
00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:04.640
waiting outside.

698
00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:07.230
Why didn't you wake me earlier?

699
00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:08.440
Miss.

700
00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:10.440
His Highness thought

701
00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:12.710
you're startled and weak.

702
00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:14.030
You should get more sleep.

703
00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:16.880
Ba told me in secret.

704
00:33:17.070 --> 00:33:18.070
His Highness

705
00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:19.990
hasn't slept for days.

706
00:33:20.510 --> 00:33:21.960
He seemed to be blaming himself

707
00:33:22.030 --> 00:33:23.470
over the kidnapping.

708
00:33:23.790 --> 00:33:24.550
Therefore,

709
00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:26.680
he didn't stop investigating and searching.

710
00:33:26.790 --> 00:33:28.640
Ba also told me this in secret.

711
00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:29.790
At this moment,

712
00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:31.200
you'd be the only person

713
00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:33.120
who'd persuade the Crown Prince.

714
00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:37.160
Help me to dress up.

715
00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:43.270
Your Highness.

716
00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:44.160
The coroner said

717
00:33:44.270 --> 00:33:45.750
there're bite marks of beasts

718
00:33:45.790 --> 00:33:47.270
on the dead assassins,

719
00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:48.640
but before that,

720
00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:50.600
they carried fatal sword wound.

721
00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:51.790
Do you come to clear these doubts

722
00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:52.600
with Princess Hua?

723
00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:54.270
Do you think Princess Hua will tell?

724
00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:56.470
Why do you come then?

725
00:34:05.550 --> 00:34:06.550
Your Highness.

726
00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:08.240
Have you had a good rest?

727
00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:10.510
Thanks to Your Highness,

728
00:34:10.670 --> 00:34:11.990
I've had a well rest.

729
00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:12.990
Have a seat.

730
00:34:18.990 --> 00:34:19.630
I've brought

731
00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:20.800
some tonic from the palace.

732
00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:22.990
You've suffered these days.

733
00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:25.030
Thank you, Your Highness.

734
00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:26.440
But I'm fine

735
00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:27.510
now.

736
00:34:27.670 --> 00:34:29.320
I'm not in shock anymore.

737
00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:31.190
Thanks to

738
00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:32.760
Princess Jiamin along the way.

739
00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:35.110
She kept me well-protected.

740
00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:36.510
But you belong to me.

741
00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:42.240
You manage things for me

742
00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:44.110
and you've taken the important position

743
00:34:44.150 --> 00:34:45.070
as the Ceremonial Officer.

744
00:34:45.150 --> 00:34:46.550
Now you have a safety issue.

745
00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:48.280
It's surely related to me.

746
00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:55.240
Princess Jiamin said

747
00:34:55.590 --> 00:34:57.070
the assassins

748
00:34:57.550 --> 00:34:58.840
aimed at you.

749
00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:06.630
I'm daughter of the Hua family.

750
00:35:07.470 --> 00:35:09.070
People are jealous of me.

751
00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:11.440
I've also been appointed
as the Ceremonial Officer.

752
00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:13.150
That's even more eye-catching.

753
00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:14.800
Isn't it normal

754
00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:16.510
when someone wants to kill me?

755
00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:20.800
You're optimistic.

756
00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:23.840
Have you found the murderer?

757
00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:31.280
I was scared.

758
00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:32.440
I couldn't

759
00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:33.550
think too much.

760
00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:36.360
It's really scary.

761
00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:48.800
Your Highness.

762
00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:50.190
This matter

763
00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:50.990
can't be solved

764
00:35:51.070 --> 00:35:52.150
in one day or two.

765
00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:53.800
You told me

766
00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:55.440
to take a good rest

767
00:35:55.470 --> 00:35:56.550
and take care of myself.

768
00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:59.150
You've stayed up several nights

769
00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:00.670
for the investigation.

770
00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:02.150
Think about this.

771
00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:04.190
One who could

772
00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:05.320
silently take me

773
00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:06.990
and Princess Jiamin out of the capital.

774
00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:09.280
The force behind it

775
00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:10.800
shouldn't be underestimated.

776
00:36:16.990 --> 00:36:18.190
You should take time

777
00:36:18.590 --> 00:36:20.110
to work on a great cause.

778
00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:25.320
Your Highness.

779
00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:27.510
Your Highness.

780
00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:31.280
Your Highness.

781
00:36:41.070 --> 00:36:41.840
Your Highness.

782
00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:44.070
Your Highness.

783
00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:00.440
Your Highness.

784
00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:02.060
(Jinpo Dancer Jiang Sha)
You're back.

785
00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:08.760
Use your seductive trick

786
00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:09.840
on Jin's Crown Prince

787
00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:11.070
or the Emperor.

788
00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:12.630
You don't have to waste your time

789
00:37:12.670 --> 00:37:13.440
on me.

790
00:37:14.070 --> 00:37:15.150
Your Highness.

791
00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:15.760
Get out.

792
00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:34.420
(Elegant Hall)

793
00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:35.920
Shouldn't it be useful?

794
00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:38.510
Since His Highness

795
00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:39.320
deceived

796
00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:40.630
by a girl

797
00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:41.440
named Hua Liuli,

798
00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:44.070
he's overly vigilant

799
00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:46.030
about women.

800
00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:47.360
You

801
00:37:47.470 --> 00:37:48.990
just wait here.

802
00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:51.840
You mustn't mess with His Highness.

803
00:37:56.260 --> 00:37:57.860
(Supreme Court)

804
00:38:00.190 --> 00:38:00.990
Please, Princess.

805
00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:03.720
Thank you for your cooperation.

806
00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:04.990
It's really hard work.

807
00:38:06.110 --> 00:38:07.400
Thank you very much.

808
00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:13.960
Prince Ying.

809
00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:17.360
Princess Jiamin.

810
00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:19.510
You're fine, right?

811
00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:20.590
I'm fine.

812
00:38:21.470 --> 00:38:22.440
Why do you come?

813
00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:23.630
I'm glad that you're fine.

814
00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:24.920
I'm glad.

815
00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:27.190
Right. What about Princess Hua?

816
00:38:27.470 --> 00:38:28.320
Weren't you

817
00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:29.280
kidnapped together?

818
00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:30.030
Where's she?

819
00:38:30.110 --> 00:38:31.360
Why hasn't she come out?

820
00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:32.590
How is she doing now?

821
00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:36.320
I see.

822
00:38:37.470 --> 00:38:39.240
You come to receive Hua Liuli.

823
00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:41.800
How will she be at a place

824
00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:42.960
like the Supreme Court?

825
00:38:44.190 --> 00:38:45.760
I've just come back from searching for you

826
00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:46.920
in Nan Prefecture.

827
00:38:47.110 --> 00:38:49.110
I hear you've been brought
to the Supreme Court.

828
00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:51.030
So I also want to ask about Princess Hua...

829
00:38:51.070 --> 00:38:52.030
She who is feeble

830
00:38:52.070 --> 00:38:53.320
has gone home long ago.

831
00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:58.320
Go ahead and find whoever you like.

832
00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:00.960
Receive whoever you like.

833
00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:04.280
I don't want to see you anymore.

834
00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:14.800
Miss, you should get in the carriage.

835
00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:23.960
Did I

836
00:39:24.030 --> 00:39:25.190
say something wrong just now?

837
00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:26.280
No.

838
00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:27.360
Why was she

839
00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:28.990
so angry?

840
00:39:31.470 --> 00:39:32.400
Well...

841
00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:35.960
Maybe she's distraught

842
00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:37.150
by her own messiness

843
00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:38.720
when she saw me.

844
00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:40.920
Your Highness is right.

845
00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:44.150
So that's how it is.

846
00:39:58.470 --> 00:39:59.800
(What a fool.)

847
00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:14.900
(Supporting the Prince Ying)

848
00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:40.360
(I'm the biggest fool.)

849
00:40:42.510 --> 00:40:45.190
He doesn't care about me at all.

850
00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:39.180
(Artificial Times)

851
00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:40.960
Eat more.

852
00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:42.880
So you'll have the strength to run away.

853
00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:48.240
And I've heard that

854
00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:49.400
people who cry while eating

855
00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:51.320
will definitely make it through.

856
00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:54.590
But, you know,

857
00:41:56.190 --> 00:41:57.320
you've gotten fat

858
00:41:57.550 --> 00:41:58.630
again lately.

859
00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:01.510
So what if I'm fat?

860
00:42:01.590 --> 00:42:02.760
Isn't it cute to be chubby?

861
00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:07.840
Eat more.

862
00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:09.670
Chubby is cute.
