=Episode 5=

17
00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.040
Plum has blossomed in the palace.

18
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.990
Consort Xian is worried

19
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.960
that you haven't got
used to the capital.

20
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.560
So she wants to invite you to look
at the flowers at Jade Garden.

21
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:46.920
Please do her the honour.

22
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.320
Thank you, Consort Xian,

23
00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:51.760
but

24
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.040
I haven't been to

25
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.120
that kind of place.

26
00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.270
I really don't know

27
00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.600
what I should prepare.

28
00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:59.400
Consort Xian said

29
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.430
your arrival would be more than enough.

30
00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:01.760
You don't need to prepare anything.

31
00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:02.600
She said

32
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.680
she's a close friend

33
00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:04.680
of General Wei in early years.

34
00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:06.120
She's been viewing you

35
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.400
as her niece.

36
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.160
Please take it easy.

37
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.720
I thank Consort Xian

38
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.230
for inviting me then.

39
00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.670
I'll be there.

40
00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:25.760
Since when

41
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:26.320
is Consort Xian

42
00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:27.920
a close friend of General Wei?

43
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.950
General Wei has never

44
00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.070
mentioned it before.

45
00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:31.950
My mother said this long ago.

46
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.230
When one deliberately
tries to please you,

47
00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:34.790
beware of his or her talk.

48
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:35.320
Moreover,

49
00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:36.390
Consort Xian

50
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.880
is the mother of Prince Ying.

51
00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.720
She must have heard of some rumours.

52
00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.510
Why did you agree to attend then?

53
00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.040
It's not a flower banquet.

54
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.510
She clearly has an ulterior motive.

55
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.830
You know nothing.

56
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.830
A feeble beauty like me

57
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.920
is kind and gentle.

58
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.600
I couldn't say no to her.

59
00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.040
Moreover,

60
00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.600
is it really possible to
back out of the marriage

61
00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:57.950
after spreading the news?

62
00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:59.670
(Invitation Letter)

63
00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:00.390
(Invitation Letter)
Not necessarily.

64
00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:01.920
Yes, not necessarily.

65
00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.440
His Majesty may not see it,

66
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.000
even when the people do.

67
00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.350
Also, His Majesty may not believe in

68
00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.790
a marketplace rumour.

69
00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.390
In his case,

70
00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.200
he would definitely
want to observe first.

71
00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.000
So the plum blossom banquet

72
00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.950
is both a challenge and a chance.

73
00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:19.510
If we can

74
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:20.720
plan in advance,

75
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.550
we'll be able to kill
two birds with one stone.

76
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.040
Which two birds?

77
00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.830
Back out of Prince Ying's marriage.

78
00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.950
Stop Crown Prince

79
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:31.630
from picking on us again.

80
00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:33.040
Two birds.

81
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:36.950
So you're the stone.

82
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.320
Don't spout nonsense.

83
00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.860
(Invitation Letter)

84
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.320
Even His Majesty has been
fooled by Hua Liuli.

85
00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:46.380
(Banquet at Jade Garden for Ladies)
He even wants to

86
00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.260
(Princess Jiamin is invited.)
betroth her to Prince Ying.

87
00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:49.760
I swear to be her enemy.

88
00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.950
plum blossom banquet.

89
00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.790
Let's go together.

90
00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.440
Isn't Consort Xian's

91
00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.200
plum blossom banquet meant

92
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.720
for His Majesty's arrangement
of marriage?

93
00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:57.420
I don't think

94
00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:58.670
we should go.

95
00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:59.480
Why not?

96
00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.390
Be gentle.

97
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:03.630
Listen to me.

98
00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.950
Based on the novels I've read,

99
00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:07.630
your family background,

100
00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:08.480
elegance and appearance

101
00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.350
will outshine

102
00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.630
other noblewomen

103
00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:11.720
at the plum blossom banquet.

104
00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.280
And Hua Liuli

105
00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.280
comes from countryside.

106
00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:15.390
She's no match for you.

107
00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.190
What if Prince Ying

108
00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.720
falls for you at first sight?

109
00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:21.550
Do you mean

110
00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.790
that Prince Ying

111
00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.040
will ignore others

112
00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.400
if I stand out in a crowd?

113
00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:27.660
Yes.

114
00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.340
Isn't it a banquet organised

115
00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.820
for Prince Ying and Hua Liuli?

116
00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:32.340
You'll steal the show.

117
00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:33.600
I have to go then.

118
00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.280
You have to?

119
00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:36.510
I mean

120
00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:37.920
Hua Liuli sponged off

121
00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.870
my family earlier on.

122
00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.460
I should go to steal

123
00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:40.360
the show from her.

124
00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:41.390
Don't you agree?

125
00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.460
Yes.

126
00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:43.360
We should be well-prepared.

127
00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.280
(Diarrhoea.)

128
00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:52.280
(Bring it.)

129
00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:53.360
(It'll be useful.)

130
00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:02.280
I'm so mad.

131
00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:03.190
I'm so mad.

132
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.720
I'm so mad!

133
00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.240
I'm so mad.

134
00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:07.600
Miss.

135
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:08.780
Why are you fanning yourself

136
00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:09.860
in a cold day?

137
00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:10.620
Don't you feel cold?

138
00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.420
I fan myself to get the feelings.

139
00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.120
I might fall sick for real.

140
00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.390
Who made you mad?

141
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.430
It's Princess Jiamin.

142
00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:20.630
I failed to make a purchase again.

143
00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.430
Does she cut our food supply again?

144
00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:23.720
Princess Jiamin

145
00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:24.870
has really gone too far.

146
00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:26.390
No. It's fabric.

147
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.840
Fabric?

148
00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.480
I was so scared.

149
00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:31.990
I thought it's food.

150
00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:34.160
Fabric is very important, too.

151
00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.120
The capital has many rules.

152
00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.920
If you wear this old dress

153
00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:38.870
to the plum blossom banquet,

154
00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:40.510
you'll be mocked by others.

155
00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:41.600
It's definitely

156
00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.160
a trick of theirs.

157
00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:44.310
You know what?

158
00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.360
Sir, give me a bolt of cloth.

159
00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:46.950
Give me a bolt of cloth.

160
00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.040
Excuse me.

161
00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:49.620
(Sold out)

162
00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:51.510
Sorry, it's sold out.

163
00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:52.240
Come again next time.

164
00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:54.630
Not just one shop, but all.

165
00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.480
They're clearly targeting us.

166
00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.720
I've heard that most
of the fabric business

167
00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:00.680
in the capital is monopolised
by Minister Tian's family.

168
00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.720
There's nothing we can do

169
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:04.190
when they close the shops.

170
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.160
What should we do then?

171
00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:09.750
It's so annoying.

172
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:11.840
Where should we get fabric?

173
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:14.360
Do you still remember

174
00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:15.240
all this stuff that we brought

175
00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.480
from the princess' mansion
the other day?

176
00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:20.120
Your Highness.

177
00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.310
I watched Princess Hua

178
00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:21.950
took the medicine.

179
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:23.480
She finished it all
without leaving a drop.

180
00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.550
She didn't curse me again, did she?

181
00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:28.360
She didn't.

182
00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:29.280
Princess Hua

183
00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:30.510
thanked you.

184
00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:32.750
She also hoped that you'd be scratched

185
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:34.630
by Fafa for a few more times today.

186
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:45.720
What is she working on these days?

187
00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:46.950
Your Highness.

188
00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.630
Princess Hua is working on matters

189
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.240
related to the plum blossom banquet.

190
00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:52.120
The plum blossom banquet?

191
00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:53.630
It's organised by Consort Xian.

192
00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:55.070
Princess Hua has been invited.

193
00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.990
She doesn't want him to marry her,

194
00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.240
yet wants to use her status

195
00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.280
to dispel the rumours.

196
00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:03.720
Both the mother and son
are really smart.

197
00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:04.630
However,

198
00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:05.870
Princess Hua has put in a lot of effort

199
00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:07.240
for the banquet.

200
00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:09.310
I bet she wants to attend it
in a proper manner.

201
00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.360
Does she want to marry
Prince Ying so much?

202
00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:14.990
However, based on her personality,

203
00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:16.430
she won't

204
00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.310
obediently choose to marry a person.

205
00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:21.950
What is she up to this time?

206
00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:25.600
Please come inside.

207
00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:26.720
Consort Xian

208
00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:28.990
has prepared stoves and
warm bottles for everyone.

209
00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:30.630
Princess Jiamin.

210
00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:32.720
It's Princess Jiamin.

211
00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:33.360
Minmin.

212
00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:34.360
You're wearing a beautiful dress

213
00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.430
today.

214
00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:36.510
What is it made of?

215
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:39.040
The new cloud brocade
from my family's textile shop.

216
00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:40.630
It's really beautiful.

217
00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:41.550
I also want to make one.

218
00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:43.630
The arrival of Princess Hua.

219
00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:50.550
- Greetings, Princess Hua.
- Greetings, Princess Hua.

220
00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:52.720
She has limited choices of dress

221
00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:54.070
to wear indeed.

222
00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:55.630
Is she so feeble?

223
00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:57.280
She bundles up as if she's a rice dumpling.

224
00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:00.950
However, her hair accessory

225
00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.310
is rather unique.

226
00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:08.840
It's shabby.

227
00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:10.480
It's certainly unpresentable.

228
00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:12.280
Why would General Wei

229
00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:13.360
have a daughter like her?

230
00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:17.840
(Ankang Garden)

231
00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:18.540
Fafa.

232
00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.360
Fafa, do you want to eat?

233
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:24.070
Your Highness.

234
00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:24.920
You've been reading

235
00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.550
for nearly two hours.

236
00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.070
What are you reading?

237
00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:30.360
Some intelligence about
small countries in Western Regions.

238
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:31.920
Jinpo has lost a war.

239
00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:33.600
These small countries' movements

240
00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:34.630
are quite interesting somehow.

241
00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:38.990
Your Highness.

242
00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:40.100
You actually have

243
00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:41.560
Dew Wine today.

244
00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:42.870
I heard

245
00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:44.120
that it's also the liquor

246
00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:44.870
used to serve

247
00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:46.630
the noblewomen at Consort Xian's

248
00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:47.790
plum blossom banquet today.

249
00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:50.600
The banquet

250
00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:52.990
should've begun at this hour.

251
00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:07.300
I didn't expect her to dance so well.

252
00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:08.060
Yes.

253
00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:09.720
(She's just a bimbo.)

254
00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:11.120
(She looks nice but is useless.)

255
00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.030
What do you think about her dance?

256
00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:35.790
Bravo!

257
00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:38.060
Yuan Wei, clap your hands.

258
00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:38.820
Isn't she awesome?

259
00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:39.790
Hurry up.

260
00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:46.080
I didn't expect you

261
00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.750
to perform a sword dance.

262
00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:49.390
As the saying goes,

263
00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.600
it comes like thunderclap

264
00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:53.840
and leaves like a river.

265
00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.480
Do you learn

266
00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:57.360
the sword dance from Princess Shun'an?

267
00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:58.870
It's taught by my mother.

268
00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:00.790
I didn't expect you to know.

269
00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:02.720
Princess Shun'an

270
00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.720
admired General Wei back then.

271
00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:06.600
She followed her every day

272
00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:08.320
and learnt the dance.

273
00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:10.630
She claimed that she
wanted to perform for him.

274
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:12.560
It's my mother's past.

275
00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.320
Speaking of General Wei,

276
00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:18.270
I wonder if her daughter

277
00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:21.030
has anything to perform.

278
00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:25.360
(Miss, what to do?)

279
00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:27.390
(She's ill-intentioned.)

280
00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:29.990
(Miss, they clearly)

281
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:31.120
(have an ulterior motive.)

282
00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:32.440
(She's such a bully.)

283
00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:33.720
(Don't be scared.)

284
00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:36.510
(Is Consort Xian giving me a hard time)

285
00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:38.600
(because...)

286
00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:45.870
Consort Xian.

287
00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:47.630
I'll

288
00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:49.320
obey you then.

289
00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:06.670
She has a beautiful dress.

290
00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:08.910
You aren't allowed
to say it's beautiful.

Wonderful.

318
00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:25.790
It's amazing.

319
00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:35.320
(I didn't expect)

320
00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:37.320
(Hua Liuli to be so
difficult to deal with.)

321
00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:38.630
(I wanted to give her a hard time)

322
00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:40.600
(and let her know she
didn't deserve my son.)

323
00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:41.600
(It's unexpectedly)

324
00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:43.740
(given her a chance to shine.)

325
00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:44.910
(Jade Garden)

326
00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:45.670
Miss.

327
00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:46.750
Put this on.

328
00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:47.990
Don't catch a cold.

329
00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:50.870
Consort Xian.

330
00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:53.440
I've presented a humble dance.

331
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:55.120
What's the dance

332
00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:55.990
that you've performed?

333
00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:57.360
Consort Xian.

334
00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:00.270
It's called Face Dance.

335
00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:01.990
Why is it called Face Dance?

336
00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:03.990
I don't know if you noticed.

337
00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:06.270
The silk brushed past everyone

338
00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:07.960
for countless times just now,

339
00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:09.990
but it didn't hit anyone's face.

340
00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:11.910
It's called Face Dance

341
00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.150
when it didn't hit anyone's face.

342
00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:15.080
Otherwise,

343
00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:16.390
it's called Slap Dance.

344
00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:20.860
- Qinghan Prefecture
- It's fine.

345
00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:22.390
- is really interesting.
- Don't be angry with her.

346
00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:24.200
Qinghan Prefecture is rather far.

347
00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:26.990
Hence, happiness is much simpler there.

348
00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:28.600
Unfortunately,

349
00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:30.840
I really have poor health.

350
00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:32.390
So that's all

351
00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:33.790
I'd dance today.

352
00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:36.120
You're really creative.

353
00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:38.480
Whether it's the hair accessory, costume

354
00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:39.910
or the dance,

355
00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:42.750
it's really an eye-opener to me.

356
00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:44.200
I really wonder why General Wei

357
00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:45.720
has a daughter like you.

358
00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:47.080
You're really annoying.

359
00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:48.240
You don't inherit

360
00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:49.600
her elegance at all.

361
00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:53.600
Yes. I was born into a hard life.

362
00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:55.720
Since I was in my mother's womb,

363
00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:57.720
I went to war with my mother.

364
00:14:58.390 --> 00:14:59.840
I'm unlike Princess Jiamin,

365
00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:01.990
who lives in the capital

366
00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:03.360
and is protected

367
00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:04.910
by both the princess and minister.

368
00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:07.670
No matter what,

369
00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:09.120
I'm better than you,

370
00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:09.960
who used pastries

371
00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:11.120
in exchange for our treasure.

372
00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:17.960
Minmin.

373
00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:21.720
However, the pastries from me

374
00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:23.670
are really my token of appreciation

375
00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:26.390
from the border.

376
00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:31.270
Consort Xian.

377
00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:32.910
I'll also make a move first.

378
00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:40.840
(How eloquent.)

379
00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:42.870
(I underestimated you.)

380
00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:50.990
We

381
00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:52.910
won't be exposed, right?

382
00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:54.440
We're both dressed up

383
00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:55.150
perfectly.

384
00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:55.910
Why would we be discovered?

385
00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:58.120
We can just make do with it.

386
00:15:59.270 --> 00:15:59.790
We can't

387
00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:01.390
go back to Hua Liuli's mansion.

388
00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:03.320
We can only use poison in the palace.

389
00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:05.030
Where's our big brother?

390
00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:06.240
He said

391
00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:07.360
he'd come back

392
00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:08.240
at the right time.

393
00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:19.440
Princess Hua.

394
00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:20.870
You danced gracefully.

395
00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:21.960
You also have a nice dress.

396
00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:23.030
- Yes.
- True.

397
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:23.870
Thank you.

398
00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:28.030
It's really a feast for the eyes.

399
00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:29.910
Hua Liuli, stop.

400
00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:32.630
What's the matter, Princess Jiamin?

401
00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:33.320
Why?

402
00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:34.840
Can't I look for you if there's nothing?

403
00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:39.080
You've been targeting me.

404
00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:41.180
Have you fallen for Prince Ying?

405
00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:43.360
What are you talking about?

406
00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:44.440
Only someone like Yun Han

407
00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:46.240
can attract me.

408
00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:46.960
Yes.

409
00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:48.630
I see.

410
00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:51.240
Princess Jiamin.

411
00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:54.120
What do you mean by this?

412
00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:55.440
What about Yun Han?

413
00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:57.630
I'm so handsome.

414
00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:59.480
Can Yun Han compare to me?

415
00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:00.620
Go.

416
00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:01.960
Get Yun Han over here.

417
00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:03.790
Yun Han is so

418
00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:05.040
handsome.

419
00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:06.670
I meant nothing.

420
00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:07.760
You heard it wrongly.

421
00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:09.430
We have to go.

422
00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:10.220
Come on.

423
00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:12.190
It's too cold.

424
00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:13.150
Let's bundle up.

425
00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:15.120
She's unreasonable.

426
00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:17.390
Princess Hua.

427
00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:19.040
Prince Ying.

428
00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:20.840
I'm happy to see you

429
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.080
at the plum blossom banquet

430
00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:23.800
with no health issue.

431
00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:27.040
Hao'er, come over.

432
00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:36.150
Greetings, mother.

433
00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:38.190
I organised

434
00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:41.000
the banquet with an agenda today.

435
00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:42.040
A few days ago,

436
00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:44.390
Yuanhao startled Princess Hua
while riding a horse.

437
00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:46.230
He didn't handle it properly.

438
00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:48.120
In front of everyone today,

439
00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:50.560
Yuanhao should apologise

440
00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:51.470
to Princess Hua.

441
00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:54.800
It's a great privilege
for the Hua family.

442
00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:57.190
A prince is told to
apologise to Princess Hua.

443
00:17:57.910 --> 00:17:59.120
She's only startled by a horse.

444
00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:01.560
Why is Hua Liuli so pampered

445
00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:02.630
and unreasonable?

446
00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:03.390
Mother.

447
00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:05.150
It's just a misunderstanding.

448
00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:07.360
Princess Hua doesn't mind it.

449
00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:09.470
Someone tried to drive
a wedge between us.

450
00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:11.600
Yes, Consort Xian.

451
00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:12.870
Prince Ying

452
00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:13.910
shouldn't apologise to me.

453
00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:16.470
He did nothing wrong.

454
00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:17.870
Moreover,

455
00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:20.470
it's more than I could bear.

456
00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:22.360
Mother.

457
00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:24.710
Since Princess Hua said that,

458
00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:26.230
I don't have to apologise.

459
00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:28.120
There must be a closure today.

460
00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:31.040
(She's making concessions to
gain an advantage. She's cunning.)

461
00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:32.230
Mother.

462
00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:33.840
What do you want to do?

463
00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:34.670
Mother.

464
00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:36.710
You are to obey me.

465
00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:38.600
Do you want to beat Crown Prince?

466
00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:46.670
I have to bother you to do it

467
00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:48.320
in person if we want to stop

468
00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:49.710
the rumours.

469
00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:51.430
(What a wily old fox.)

470
00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:54.840
I'm just

471
00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:57.190
a girl from the countryside
at the border.

472
00:18:57.390 --> 00:18:59.000
I don't have such a reputation.

473
00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:00.190
Well...

474
00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:03.390
Don't worry too much. It's just...

475
00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:04.230
Moreover,

476
00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:07.910
if I beat Prince Ying

477
00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:09.390
with a cane today,

478
00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:11.760
I won't be able to leave here alive.

479
00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:14.040
My status

480
00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:15.910
doesn't need an apology.

481
00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:18.190
It does make sense.

482
00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:20.190
She's putting Princess Hua

483
00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:21.430
in a tough spot.

484
00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:22.280
Yes.

485
00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:23.470
Princess Hua is forced

486
00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:24.600
to accept an apology.

487
00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:26.230
- Yes.
- True.

488
00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:28.280
I pity Princess Hua.

489
00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:29.040
Princess Hua,

490
00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:30.710
you're the daughter
of Protector General.

491
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.710
I wonder how

492
00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:33.870
my spoilt child

493
00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:35.000
offended you

494
00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:36.800
to have gained his current reputation.

495
00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:38.910
Since Princess Hua couldn't do it,

496
00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:40.630
let me personally teach him

497
00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:42.120
a lesson.

498
00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:44.150
I hope you'll forgive
Hao'er, Princess Hua.

499
00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:48.150
Mother.

500
00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:52.390
Spoilt child.

501
00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:53.000
Mother.

502
00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:53.910
Spoilt child.

503
00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:55.280
Spoilt child.

504
00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:56.840
Spoilt child.

505
00:19:57.150 --> 00:19:57.520
Mother.

506
00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:58.280
Spoilt child.

507
00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:01.280
Ungrateful child.

508
00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:05.120
Yuan Wei.

509
00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:06.360
Put on my cloak.

510
00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:08.080
Save it for the ill beauty.

511
00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:13.080
Is it painful?

512
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.710
Hao'er, you're hit

513
00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:19.670
but I feel sad, too.

514
00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:21.560
(She wanted to make
a fool of me at first.)

515
00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:22.950
(She's trying to gain
others' sympathy now)

516
00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:23.840
(to pressure me.)

517
00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:24.870
(Consort Xian,)

518
00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:26.520
(you're thinking too much.)

519
00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:28.600
Attendant.

520
00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:30.670
Bring Prince Ying to
an imperial physician.

521
00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:31.280
Yes, Your Highness.

522
00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:31.870
Go now.

523
00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:38.120
(You're still no match)

524
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.520
(for Consort Xian, Princess Hua.)

525
00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:43.120
(I have to come up with
an idea the soonest.)

526
00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:48.470
(It's them again.)

527
00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:50.280
(I have an idea.)

528
00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:55.040
The weather is so cold.

529
00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:56.760
Attendants.

530
00:20:58.190 --> 00:21:00.040
Can you pour me a cup of hot liquor?

531
00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:01.600
Here we come.

532
00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:02.320
Sure.

533
00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:04.800
The plum is in full bloom.

534
00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:07.360
Hurry up.

535
00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:15.320
Find it now.

536
00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:19.760
(The drug to cause diarrhoea
comes in handy.)

537
00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:21.710
(As long as I drink it,)

538
00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:23.710
(the marriage will not happen.)

539
00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:26.040
(What is Hua Liuli up to now?)

540
00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:31.360
Where's the drug? I can't find it.

541
00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:33.520
Are you looking for this?

542
00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:35.760
Thank you.

543
00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:37.950
Hurry up.

544
00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:39.600
It'll be a problem if anyone finds out.

545
00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:52.430
Princess Hua.

546
00:21:56.910 --> 00:21:57.710
Thank you for your cooperation.

547
00:21:58.430 --> 00:21:59.000
Go.

548
00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:01.320
Go now.

549
00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:02.520
Let's go.

550
00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:05.080
Does it mean we've made it?

551
00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:05.670
I think so.

552
00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:06.760
We've added the drug.

553
00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:08.280
Let's go.

554
00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:12.230
(She's drugging herself.)

555
00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:18.390
Princess Hua.

556
00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:20.840
(Crown Prince.)

557
00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:22.840
Crown Prince is really handsome.

558
00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:27.080
Crown Prince.

559
00:22:29.910 --> 00:22:30.600
Princess Hua.

560
00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:32.600
Where do you want to go?

561
00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:35.280
Crown Prince.

562
00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:36.910
The weather is cold.

563
00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:38.560
I want to go home.

564
00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:39.910
You're disrespecting

565
00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:41.280
me.

566
00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:42.360
You want to leave

567
00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:43.560
as soon as I arrive.

568
00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:46.230
You even want to leave
with the wine cup.

569
00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:48.360
It seems you like

570
00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:49.910
Consort Xian's Dew Wine very much.

571
00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:51.040
Yes.

572
00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:52.800
I find it flavourful.

573
00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.120
I also want

574
00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:55.470
to ask for a bottle of it

575
00:22:55.670 --> 00:22:57.320
from Consort Xian to bring home.

576
00:22:57.630 --> 00:22:58.150
Really?

577
00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:00.120
Let me try it, too.

578
00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:05.870
(Let me take)

579
00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:07.000
(the drug instead.)

580
00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:09.320
I've finished it.

581
00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:13.430
(Why did you really drink it, Miss?)

582
00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:19.230
Princess Hua!

583
00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:19.760
Princess Hua!

584
00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:20.910
Princess Hua!

585
00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:21.840
What happened?

586
00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:22.870
What's going on?

587
00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:23.800
I don't know.

588
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:24.760
Summon the imperial physician!

589
00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:25.710
Block all entrances of the scene!

590
00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:29.460
(Tranquility and Elegance)

591
00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:39.320
It has nothing to do with me.

592
00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:41.390
- It's unrelated to me.
- Princess Hua.

593
00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:43.150
Princess Hua.

594
00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:45.710
Princess Hua.

595
00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:50.230
Physician, is there an antidote?

596
00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:51.190
I have to know

597
00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:52.670
what she's poisoned with

598
00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:55.040
to prescribe the right
medicine, Crown Prince.

599
00:23:57.260 --> 00:23:57.870
Crown Prince.

600
00:23:58.670 --> 00:23:59.560
We discovered

601
00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:00.800
a ceramic bottle outside.

602
00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:11.390
Three Breath Powder.

603
00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:12.870
One who is poisoned by it

604
00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:14.280
will die

605
00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:16.190
in a short period of time.

606
00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:22.470
Crown Prince, I'm unrelated to this.

607
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.390
You must find the assassin

608
00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:26.630
to clear my name.

609
00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:29.040
Has the time passed?

610
00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:30.840
I suppose so.

611
00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:38.080
Princess Hua.

612
00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:40.470
Princess Hua.

613
00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:42.950
Princess Hua!

614
00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:45.800
Princess Hua!

615
00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:54.840
(Fortunately, I replaced the powder.)

616
00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:57.390
(I'm afraid it's time)

617
00:24:57.670 --> 00:24:59.630
(for the diarrhoea to take effect.)

618
00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:07.360
Miss, you're finally awake.

619
00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:10.600
Crown Prince.

620
00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:14.120
Someone intended to poison me.

621
00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:16.710
Are you all right?

622
00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:18.800
How are you feeling now?

623
00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:22.600
I feel

624
00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:25.840
I'm fine now.

625
00:25:28.910 --> 00:25:30.800
- That's great.
- She's fine now.

626
00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:36.060
Yuan Wei.

627
00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:37.600
Miss, where do you want to go?

628
00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:39.700
I want to use the bathroom.

629
00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:41.870
What's going on?

630
00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:42.630
I don't know.

631
00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:55.360
I can't hold it anymore.

632
00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:13.390
Princess Hua has an unusual pulse.

633
00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:15.230
She can actually convert

634
00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:17.390
the symptom of Three Breath Powder
into diarrhoea.

635
00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:19.600
(This bottle of Three Breath Powder
is still full.)

636
00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:21.430
(It's clear that it wasn't
added in the liquor.)

637
00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:23.950
(The symptom of diarrhoea)

638
00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:25.870
(is similar to the diarrhoea drug.)

639
00:26:27.670 --> 00:26:28.800
The carriage is still ahead.

640
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:29.870
Are you able to make it there?

641
00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:36.800
Let me support her.

642
00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:44.430
Although you're fine now,

643
00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:46.760
the assassin has yet to be caught.

644
00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:48.630
It's safer

645
00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:50.600
with me escorting you.

646
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.820
I shouldn't bother you, Crown Prince.

647
00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:53.560
Princess Hua.

648
00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:55.430
You aren't feeling well.

649
00:26:56.150 --> 00:26:56.500
No one

650
00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:57.760
will talk about this.

651
00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:00.150
Come on.

652
00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:07.870
It's just you and me.

653
00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:10.630
You don't have to look

654
00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:11.870
so scared.

655
00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:13.950
I was really

656
00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:15.670
scared today.

657
00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:17.870
However, I'm shivering now

658
00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:21.000
because I'm a little underdressed.

659
00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:22.870
Moreover,

660
00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:25.600
I really feel a bit unwell.

661
00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:38.870
There's no need to beat

662
00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:42.430
anyone at such a banquet.

663
00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:46.760
It concerns my family's reputation.

664
00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:49.390
I had to put up a fight.

665
00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:54.560
I have a question though.

666
00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:56.190
What is it?

667
00:27:57.390 --> 00:27:58.520
You'd been

668
00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:00.150
pushing me all the while.

669
00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:03.360
Why did you come to help me today?

670
00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:09.150
When did I help you?

671
00:28:10.150 --> 00:28:10.840
Walk slowly.

672
00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:15.600
There're a lot of tricks

673
00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:17.320
at the plum blossom banquet.

674
00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:20.000
While preserving your family's honour,

675
00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:22.430
you prevented the marriage
from moving forward

676
00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.630
and made the assassins
fail their mission.

677
00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:26.390
You've killed many birds with one stone.

678
00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:35.520
(I surely know)

679
00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:38.000
(the pain of moving forward alone.)

680
00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:39.430
(Hua Liuli.)

681
00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:42.670
(I just want to see your true heart.)

682
00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:45.910
Miss.

683
00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:48.080
Miss.

684
00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:49.430
Miss!

685
00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:50.600
Keep quiet.

686
00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:52.190
Who is it exactly?

687
00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:57.910
Song!

688
00:28:58.470 --> 00:29:00.390
Song, hurry up!

689
00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:01.220
- Miss!
- Miss!

690
00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:01.800
Miss.

691
00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:03.150
What's happening?

692
00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:04.040
I am not dead yet.

693
00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:07.150
Bring my father's

694
00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:08.320
antidote pill.

695
00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:09.870
Antidote pill?

696
00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:11.800
Song.

697
00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:14.390
Inform all attendants

698
00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:17.080
that no one must say anything

699
00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:19.320
about me being poisoned.

700
00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:21.000
I understand.

701
00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:21.630
Miss.

702
00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:22.140
Hurry up.

703
00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:23.500
Go back to the room now.

704
00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:27.870
It's painful, right?

705
00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:32.320
It's painful.

706
00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:33.190
Let me blow the wound.

707
00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:36.670
I didn't want to beat you.

708
00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:38.840
Poor child.

709
00:29:43.150 --> 00:29:43.950
Stop crying.

710
00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:45.120
What's the point of crying?

711
00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:46.560
Yuanhao.

712
00:29:49.230 --> 00:29:50.430
Apply medicine.

713
00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:52.600
Yes, father.

714
00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:06.800
What have you done?

715
00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:09.710
Yuanhao knocked someone out
while riding a horse.

716
00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:11.470
It's spread all over the capital.

717
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.280
It's fine if you wanted to

718
00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:15.230
apologise to her by
organising a banquet.

719
00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:17.280
You beat your child in front of

720
00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:18.520
so many people.

721
00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:20.800
What about Yuanhao's pride?

722
00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:23.120
I didn't want to beat him either.

723
00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:24.980
It's all because of Hua Liuli.

724
00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:26.430
She's very good at
pretending to be pitiful.

725
00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:27.870
She put me in that situation.

726
00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:29.560
I had to beat Yuanhao.

727
00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:31.800
Wasn't beating Yuanhao

728
00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:32.840
akin to beating

729
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.390
myself, too?

730
00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:36.800
You really should be beaten.

731
00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:39.080
Your Majesty, I was wrong.

732
00:30:42.910 --> 00:30:44.360
Do you know what you've done wrong?

733
00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:47.800
I...

734
00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:50.710
I don't know what I've done wrong.

735
00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:52.840
Look.

736
00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:55.280
You knew inviting Princess Hua

737
00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:56.520
would get you in trouble.

738
00:30:57.390 --> 00:30:59.340
You should've screened

739
00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:01.080
the people in your invitation list.

740
00:31:01.910 --> 00:31:03.390
You even let assassins in.

741
00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:05.560
It's my carelessness.

742
00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:07.360
What about the assassins?

743
00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:11.040
Your Majesty.

744
00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:13.710
Are you suspecting me

745
00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:17.190
of trying to assassinate Princess Hua?

746
00:31:17.390 --> 00:31:18.910
I really wouldn't dare.

747
00:31:20.390 --> 00:31:23.520
Your Majesty, I really wouldn't dare.

748
00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:28.840
Let's not mention

749
00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:31.670
the betrothal for now.

750
00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:33.320
Really?

751
00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:41.910
Look at you.

752
00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:46.670
I can't help but suspect you of hiring

753
00:31:46.670 --> 00:31:48.080
the assassins.

754
00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:49.040
Your Majesty.

755
00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:52.120
I wouldn't dare.

756
00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:54.600
I'm innocent, Your Majesty.

757
00:31:57.560 --> 00:31:59.230
Fine. Get up.

758
00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:02.950
Thank you, Your Majesty.

759
00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:08.000
I've arranged

760
00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:12.470
for Crown Prince to investigate
the attempted assassination.

761
00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:14.760
How dare anyone do that

762
00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:18.360
under my watch.

763
00:32:21.390 --> 00:32:24.190
I'm disheartened.

764
00:32:24.390 --> 00:32:25.150
Your Majesty.

765
00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:27.230
Don't worry.

766
00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:30.190
I'll let Crown Prince handle
the case impartially.

767
00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:34.150
Go back.

768
00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:36.840
I make a move first.

769
00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:45.630
(Pass my order.)

770
00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:47.470
(Track down the assassins
throughout the city.)

771
00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:49.320
(Inspect everyone,)

772
00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:50.390
(men, women, young and old.)

773
00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:04.180
(Hua Mansion)

774
00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:13.840
Yuan Wei.

775
00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:18.710
Song.

776
00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:23.150
How is Miss?

777
00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:25.800
She said she's fine now.

778
00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:29.120
I didn't take good care of her.

779
00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:32.360
Don't blame yourself.

780
00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:33.840
Hurry back to rest.

781
00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:34.910
I'll be here.

782
00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:36.190
I'll guard her.

783
00:33:36.630 --> 00:33:39.080
Song, you should also
take care of yourself.

784
00:33:39.670 --> 00:33:40.390
Go now.

785
00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:02.520
Miss!

786
00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:03.390
Miss!

787
00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:05.280
Miss, are you all right?

788
00:34:06.190 --> 00:34:06.800
How are you?

789
00:34:07.910 --> 00:34:08.460
Song.

790
00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:11.220
I wanted to take the spinning top
given by my father.

791
00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:12.440
It's there.

792
00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:13.920
I'll take it for you.

793
00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:29.710
Song, I miss my father and mother.

794
00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:32.270
When will they come back?

795
00:34:36.670 --> 00:34:37.270
Miss.

796
00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:40.230
Spin it more often when
you have nothing to do.

797
00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:42.150
The generals will be back

798
00:34:42.350 --> 00:34:43.630
when it can't

799
00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:45.710
stop spinning.

800
00:34:46.350 --> 00:34:47.960
I can do it.

801
00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:13.000
(Fortunately, I had
father's antidote pill.)

802
00:35:13.630 --> 00:35:14.310
(Otherwise, I wouldn't have)

803
00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:16.000
(cured the poison added in secret.)

804
00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:19.710
(I wonder)

805
00:35:19.830 --> 00:35:21.310
(what my father and
mother are doing now.)

806
00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:24.040
(I miss them so much.)

807
00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:31.190
Dear daughter.

808
00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:32.670
I've made

809
00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:34.120
your favourite

810
00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:35.670
soup noodle of Qinghan Prefecture.

811
00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:41.400
Tell me

812
00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:43.920
if anyone bullies you.

813
00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:45.670
I'll bring the person to you

814
00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:46.790
so that you can take it
out on him or her.

815
00:36:17.230 --> 00:36:18.270
Miss.

816
00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:21.440
Why couldn't we tell Crown Prince

817
00:36:21.630 --> 00:36:23.230
that you're poisoned for real?

818
00:36:24.670 --> 00:36:25.880
Someone else

819
00:36:26.270 --> 00:36:28.310
must be plotting behind them.

820
00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:32.670
They wanted to kill me with poison.

821
00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:35.520
I want to make them think

822
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.830
that I've seen through their evil plot.

823
00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:41.560
Therefore, the less people who know,

824
00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:43.440
the better.

825
00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:46.920
As for Crown Prince,

826
00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:50.440
I haven't figured out if he has

827
00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:53.350
kind or evil intention.

828
00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:55.440
Don't you think

829
00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:58.440
he's very complicated?

830
00:37:01.270 --> 00:37:02.560
He's indeed Crown Prince.

831
00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:03.960
He's calculating and manipulative.

832
00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:06.960
Recuperate well in the next few days.

833
00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:08.270
You can only go out

834
00:37:08.350 --> 00:37:09.350
after some days.

835
00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:11.710
I'm

836
00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:13.630
a feeble beauty in the first place.

837
00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:15.520
This is great.

838
00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:17.150
I don't have to pretend to be sick.

839
00:37:19.230 --> 00:37:20.670
Come on, Miss.

840
00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:23.750
Continue taking the medicine.

841
00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:28.960
What's wrong, Miss?

842
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:30.830
Yuan Wei.

843
00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:32.960
Your

844
00:37:33.190 --> 00:37:35.350
feeble princess believes

845
00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:38.480
she needs a candy to
go with the medicine.

846
00:37:39.710 --> 00:37:40.440
All right.

847
00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:45.660
(Righteous Radiance)

848
00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:46.150
Your Highness.

849
00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:48.190
It's really Three Breath Powder

850
00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:49.560
in the bottle found at the scene,

851
00:37:49.790 --> 00:37:50.960
but it's full.

852
00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:52.000
No one touched it.

853
00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:52.920
I know.

854
00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:54.560
She caused herself to have diarrhoea.

855
00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:56.750
She did?

856
00:37:57.670 --> 00:37:58.120
She...

857
00:37:58.440 --> 00:37:59.920
She discovered the assassins
in the first place.

858
00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:01.480
She even took the chance

859
00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:03.150
to swap their poison.

860
00:38:04.310 --> 00:38:04.920
Your Highness.

861
00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:06.830
However, there're still suspicious parts

862
00:38:06.830 --> 00:38:07.880
at the plum blossom banquet.

863
00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:09.190
We discovered this

864
00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:10.350
after verifying the list of attendance.

865
00:38:10.830 --> 00:38:11.540
Other than the two servants

866
00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:12.880
who had been knocked out,

867
00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:14.830
there's a suspicious person

868
00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:16.310
who's gone missing.

869
00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:18.000
So I think

870
00:38:18.310 --> 00:38:18.790
this person

871
00:38:18.790 --> 00:38:20.230
either colluded with Princess Hua

872
00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:22.270
or was up to something else.

873
00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:25.750
However, I can't figure out

874
00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:27.600
the reason of collusion.

875
00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:30.270
That person was up to
something else then.

876
00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:31.750
Speaking of that,

877
00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:33.190
I really want to check on

878
00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:34.520
Princess Hua.

879
00:38:34.750 --> 00:38:35.790
How is she doing now?

880
00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:38.120
She seems ill.

881
00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:39.040
She seldom comes out.

882
00:38:41.350 --> 00:38:42.560
However...

883
00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:44.310
What is it?

884
00:38:46.790 --> 00:38:48.350
Prince Ying rushed straight
to Princess Hua

885
00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:50.440
after recovering from his wound.

886
00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:52.790
Prepare a horse.

887
00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:54.710
Yes.

888
00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:57.900
(Pretentious Moments)

889
00:38:57.900 --> 00:38:59.220
(Jade Garden)

890
00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:00.480
What's the dance

891
00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:01.960
you performed just now, Princess Hua?

892
00:39:02.670 --> 00:39:04.000
Consort Xian.

893
00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:07.000
The dance is named Face Dance.

894
00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:21.750
(I said it's Dance Noodle.)

895
00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:25.190
