17
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.840
Princess Jiamin.

18
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:46.680
Do you know how much we've lost

19
00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:47.990
in a day?

20
00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.480
About 132 taels and
four strings of coin,

21
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.960
not including the cost.

22
00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.070
How do you know?

23
00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.990
I took a glance

24
00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:56.790
when you did the calculation.

25
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.920
I've lost so much in a day.

26
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.680
What to do in the future?

27
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.560
I'll figure out a way

28
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.070
to make up for your deficit.

29
00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:11.160
No worries.

30
00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:12.480
My family has plenty of money.

31
00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:14.760
I don't want

32
00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.040
to keep losing money like this.

33
00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:18.600
It's time to eat. Come on.

34
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:19.510
Go.

35
00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:20.390
May I ask?

36
00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.550
Can we still dine here?

37
00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:24.230
Yes.

38
00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.230
It's free today.

39
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:26.950
You may always eat for free

40
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.160
if you're Longjing Street residents.

41
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.040
We are Longjing Street residents.

42
00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.510
Yes.

43
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.070
Are you sure?

44
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.760
Yes.

45
00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.200
Today is the first time

46
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.000
I see

47
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.070
people from Longjing Street.

48
00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:37.510
Hong.

49
00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.230
Come and serve the customers.

50
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:40.630
Yes, Miss.

51
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.880
You...

52
00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.920
Don't you work for
the Hua family's shop?

53
00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:45.230
I...

54
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:46.480
Yes.

55
00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.440
You work for the Hua family?

56
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.670
Wait.

57
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.070
Hua Liuli actually asks her people

58
00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.600
to come and dine at my place for free?

59
00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.110
Hasn't she gone too far?

60
00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:56.160
Princess.

61
00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:57.200
Well...

62
00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.880
Even when they work
for the Hua family,

63
00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.230
we should keep our promise

64
00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.480
as long as they're from Longjing Street.

65
00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:05.700
We didn't say

66
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:06.700
we wanted to dine for free.

67
00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.510
It's nearby.

68
00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.230
You treat your customers like this.

69
00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:11.600
We don't want any meal.

70
00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:12.160
Let's go.

71
00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.060
- Wait.
- Wait, dear customers.

72
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.200
Let's go. We aren't dining here.

73
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.070
I'm Prince Ying.

74
00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.880
Can you

75
00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.320
tell me

76
00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.110
why Longjing Street
residents won't come?

77
00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.160
After we're hired

78
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.070
by Princess Hua,

79
00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:28.390
we're given shops

80
00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.440
to manage alone.

81
00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.200
Not only we're given salaries,

82
00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.670
we're viewed as shop owners.

83
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.550
We even have shares after making money.

84
00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.350
This explains why I didn't see

85
00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.670
people from Longjing Street today.

86
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:42.550
They all were working.

87
00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:43.630
We're doubtful

88
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:44.950
before that.

89
00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:46.040
Isn't this the first day?

90
00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:47.630
The shops of Princess Hua
have made money.

91
00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:48.390
Also,

92
00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.480
she didn't hesitate at all.

93
00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:50.720
She gave us the share of earnings.

94
00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:52.670
How could you say that about her?

95
00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:53.350
Let's go.

96
00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.510
Come on.

97
00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.510
I get it now.

98
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.110
I've lost.

99
00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:03.550
Princess Hua

100
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.280
is certainly better than me.

101
00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:10.390
Princess Jiamin.

102
00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.230
Am I no better than others

103
00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:13.280
in everything?

104
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.040
My father does not favour me
as much as he favours Crown Prince.

105
00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.160
I wanted to do something
to draw my father's attention,

106
00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.960
but I didn't do it as
well as Princess Hua.

107
00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.640
I'm indeed poor in everything.

108
00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.840
What are you doing?

109
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.480
Are you admitting defeat already?

110
00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.750
The winner is the one
who has the last laugh.

111
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.350
I'll go to my father tomorrow

112
00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:34.400
to ask for more money.

113
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:35.840
Princess.

114
00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:37.600
Did you see

115
00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.520
the smile on their faces just now?

116
00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:42.720
Princess Hua can let them

117
00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:43.670
live and work in peace

118
00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.040
even without money.

119
00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.350
I've lost the people's heart.

120
00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:49.960
I've lost this time.

121
00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.160
I'm convinced.

122
00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.160
Even when I don't have much ability,

123
00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.870
I have the courage to admit defeat.

124
00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.160
However, our shop

125
00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:01.960
has earned a lot of reputation.

126
00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:03.110
You don't have to be

127
00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:04.230
so upset.

128
00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.400
That's because you're helping me.

129
00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:07.430
Who'd compliment me?

130
00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:08.520
Says who?

131
00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:09.870
My father, Empress Dowager,

132
00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.040
the officials

133
00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.310
and the people.

134
00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:14.430
Who would compliment me?

135
00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:21.550
I think you're good.

136
00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:25.840
Princess Jiamin.

137
00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:27.600
Don't comfort me.

138
00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.280
I'm not.

139
00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.110
You're different since you're born.

140
00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.230
You have strong confidence.

141
00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:38.550
When others are frustrated,

142
00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:40.310
you encourage them.

143
00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.160
Everyone likes you.

144
00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:43.670
I'll figure out a way

145
00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:45.190
to make up for your deficit.

146
00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.190
Also,

147
00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:53.430
you mustn't give up.

148
00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:54.840
You're great.

149
00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:00.790
Princess Jiamin.

150
00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.350
You're also great,

151
00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:03.870
because you see

152
00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.750
the strength in me.

153
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:08.350
It means you have a good eye.

154
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:14.640
Is there nothing else?

155
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.480
I'm a brilliant person.

156
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:18.160
I shouldn't be sad.

157
00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:19.990
I should think about

158
00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:21.310
whether it's due to

159
00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.550
my excellence

160
00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:23.720
that makes Princess Hua think

161
00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.160
that she has to work harder

162
00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.110
to match me.

163
00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:28.430
That's why she's come up

164
00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:29.920
with this idea.

165
00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:32.400
Princess Jiamin.

166
00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:33.720
Do you agree

167
00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:34.600
with me?

168
00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.520
I also forgot a strength of yours.

169
00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:37.790
What is it?

170
00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.600
You're highly imaginative.

171
00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.110
Why is she angry again?

172
00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:49.310
Is it because

173
00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:50.790
she's stressed out

174
00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:52.430
by my excellence?

175
00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:05.670
Miss.

176
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:08.400
The snack street

177
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:09.480
is even merrier today.

178
00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:11.040
Our milk tea shop in particular

179
00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:12.640
has a long queue.

180
00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:13.480
Is it true?

181
00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:14.720
That's awesome.

182
00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:15.670
I also heard

183
00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:16.790
that Yun Han drank our milk tea

184
00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:18.310
in public at Jinling Garden.

185
00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:19.870
It drew the crowd.

186
00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.230
Is that the gift mentioned

187
00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.080
by Crown Prince?

188
00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:26.520
Miss.

189
00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.840
How is it related

190
00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:30.080
to Crown Prince?

191
00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:33.600
Miss.

192
00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.960
Have we won then?

193
00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:40.160
Where's Princess Hua?

194
00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:47.550
I'm here.

195
00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:50.040
Please accept the imperial decree.

196
00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:53.350
(Imperial Decree)

197
00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:55.520
By the imperial decree,

198
00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:58.400
the daughter of Protector General,

199
00:07:58.480 --> 00:07:59.310
Hua Liuli,

200
00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:00.640
is both virtuous and talented.

201
00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:02.480
She hires people on merit.

202
00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:04.870
She calmly responded
during the Ceremonial Officer's

203
00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:06.350
examination.

204
00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:08.040
She cultivates barren lands
and trains businessmen.

205
00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:09.720
It's sound governance,

206
00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.640
which impresses me.

207
00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:13.280
Princess Hua is specially granted

208
00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.310
with the position of Ceremonial Officer

209
00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:17.750
to lead the peace talk

210
00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.920
at States Assembly.

211
00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:21.670
The end.

212
00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.960
Thank you, Your Majesty.

213
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:36.710
Miss.

214
00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:38.520
The official uniform is really nice.

215
00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:43.640
Move, Miss.

216
00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:44.660
Go to the imperial court.

217
00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:47.260
(Hua Mansion)

218
00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:47.880
Go.

219
00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:54.780
(Hua Mansion)

220
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.310
You must use your brain more.

221
00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:10.640
Put in effort

222
00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:12.240
for our country.

223
00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:13.950
- I don't know
- (Why do we have to)

224
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.590
- what you've been thinking.
- (get up so early for the assembly?)

225
00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:17.040
(I'm so sleepy.)

226
00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:19.590
It's really delicious.

227
00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:34.360
Thank you.

228
00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:42.710
Uncle Tian.

229
00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:45.590
Why does everyone have to dine here?

230
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.830
It's the benevolence of His Majesty.

231
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.710
His Majesty takes the hard work
of his officers into account.

232
00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:52.710
Hence, this meal is provided.

233
00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:57.830
Why is your meal

234
00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:59.160
different from mine?

235
00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:04.120
I'm a third-rank officer.

236
00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.590
I'm definitely different
from you, who is just

237
00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:08.240
the Ceremonial Officer.

238
00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:10.120
I see.

239
00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:13.520
It seems

240
00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:15.400
Uncle Zhu's position isn't really high.

241
00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.120
Minister Tian.

242
00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:20.400
What do you think if I

243
00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:22.760
complain about Ceremonial Officer's

244
00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:24.430
rudeness during breakfast

245
00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:26.590
and plead to deduct

246
00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:27.760
one month's worth

247
00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:28.520
of her salary?

248
00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.360
Supervisor Zhao.

249
00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:37.950
What's the matter, Princess Hua?

250
00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.070
Minister Zhu hasn't
touched his food today.

251
00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.160
I guess

252
00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:41.920
the meal

253
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.360
doesn't match his appetite.

254
00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:44.760
Put it away for him.

255
00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.280
Officer Hua, you...

256
00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:49.040
Arrival of Crown Prince.

257
00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:54.000
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

258
00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:56.670
Aren't you

259
00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:58.000
the Ceremonial Officer?

260
00:10:58.640 --> 00:10:59.920
How do you feel about

261
00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:01.280
the first imperial court assembly?

262
00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:03.360
Come on.

263
00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:08.280
- They...
- They...

264
00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:10.550
Ignore the petty matter.

265
00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:11.190
What's happening?

266
00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:12.310
Continue your meal.

267
00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:15.160
Princess.

268
00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:17.710
You brought me out just like this.

269
00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.920
Aren't you afraid of being
reported by the Censorate

270
00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:20.790
when he knows this?

271
00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:22.220
He's deducted a month of salary

272
00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:23.400
of mine.

273
00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:24.670
A meal will be provided

274
00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:25.880
to all officers

275
00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:27.590
after every morning assembly.

276
00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:29.070
You still have to take note of

277
00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:30.790
the official etiquette while dining.

278
00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:36.000
You're quite cute

279
00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:37.760
in this small official uniform.

280
00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:39.430
Your Highness.

281
00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:41.830
Being an officer is really tiring.

282
00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:44.310
I actually want you to look at

283
00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.790
the Longjing Street
construction with me.

284
00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:49.430
Come on,

285
00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:50.640
Ceremonial Officer.

286
00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:53.310
You should carry out
the duty of your position.

287
00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:13.360
Let the officer of Works Ministry come.

288
00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:14.310
I'm here.

289
00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:17.280
Your Highness.

290
00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:19.360
I was supervising the work.

291
00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:21.240
I didn't notice your arrival.

292
00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:22.470
Were you supervising it?

293
00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:24.950
How many days have passed?

294
00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:27.070
What's with the slow progress?

295
00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:28.240
Well...

296
00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:32.190
Your Highness.

297
00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:33.590
It's because...

298
00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.520
It's because the owner of this place

299
00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:36.550
claimed

300
00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:39.640
that he's your uncle.

301
00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:41.280
He wouldn't let me touch it.

302
00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:42.670
So...

303
00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:46.160
Where is he?

304
00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:48.000
He's nearby.

305
00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:48.790
Let him come.

306
00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:50.240
Noted.

307
00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:00.070
Your Highness.

308
00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:01.640
Are you considered

309
00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:04.160
my uncle?

310
00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:05.830
Yes.

311
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:08.550
I don't expect you to remember me.

312
00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:11.160
Have I been

313
00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:12.590
too kind to you?

314
00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:14.000
Why don't I recall meeting

315
00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:15.000
an insensible person like you

316
00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:16.360
when I was little?

317
00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:17.550
Your Highness, have you

318
00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:19.590
forgotten?

319
00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:20.920
When you're five years old...

320
00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:23.240
What happened when he's five years old?

321
00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:25.950
His Highness visited
his maternal relatives

322
00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:28.830
with Empress Gonghui
when he's five years old.

323
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.070
They passed by a garden

324
00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:34.360
and saw a group of
children climbing trees.

325
00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:36.470
His Highness joined them
in climbing the trees.

326
00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:37.920
Unexpectedly,

327
00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.070
when His Highness climbed up...

328
00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:45.190
How dare you.

329
00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:46.670
You're deceiving everyone

330
00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:47.950
using my mother's name.

331
00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:49.040
The States Assembly

332
00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:50.400
is a national event.

333
00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:52.120
How dare you stop it!

334
00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:53.550
I dare not.

335
00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:54.360
Take him away

336
00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:55.270
and punish him accordingly.

337
00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:56.000
- Yes.
- Yes.

338
00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:58.040
Have mercy on me, Your Highness!

339
00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:00.360
Have mercy on me, Your Highness!

340
00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:02.710
No one must disrupt

341
00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:04.160
the States Assembly

342
00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:06.160
or he or she will be punished severely!

343
00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:07.310
- Yes.
- Yes.

344
00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:08.280
Yes.

345
00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:12.640
Work now.

346
00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:14.470
Hurry up!

347
00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:26.640
Your Highness.

348
00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:36.160
Stop being mad.

349
00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:41.000
Don't you think I'm fierce?

350
00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:45.670
You're quite fierce,

351
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.430
but I think

352
00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:48.830
you're thinking about

353
00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:49.950
the people,

354
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.240
not yourself.

355
00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:52.470
That man

356
00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:54.040
is your mother's relative.

357
00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:55.760
You didn't bend the law
for your own interests.

358
00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:57.670
Your mother wouldn't blame you.

359
00:14:57.710 --> 00:14:58.710
She'd praise you instead.

360
00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:00.790
So,

361
00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:02.590
what happened after that?

362
00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.190
Back then,

363
00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:09.920
when I wanted to start climbing,

364
00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:10.920
a child

365
00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:12.000
fell from the tree.

366
00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:13.550
I caught him by my arms.

367
00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:16.760
You're five years old.

368
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.190
Didn't you say

369
00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:19.240
you're unwell

370
00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:20.310
when you're little?

371
00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:22.880
I was in good health for a while

372
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.310
just like you did.

373
00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:26.190
However, being five years old...

374
00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:26.710
Right.

375
00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:28.400
It's a long journey
to the court assembly.

376
00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:30.920
I bet you didn't have enough sleep.

377
00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:32.830
It's hard on you.

378
00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:34.520
If you want to go back
to Jinque Street...

379
00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:35.710
Longjing Street is where

380
00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:37.120
I'll work in the future.

381
00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:39.430
It's near the western suburb.

382
00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:40.950
I want to walk there.

383
00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:42.520
Fine.

384
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:44.310
I can see you

385
00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:46.550
when I'm inspecting Longjing Street.

386
00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:49.950
- Crown Prince.
- Crown Prince.

387
00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:51.590
Move.

388
00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:55.520
(It's not like they see Crown Prince.)

389
00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:57.360
(It's like they see a ghost.)

390
00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:00.590
I don't think I should go.

391
00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:02.920
(I should cheer him up.)

392
00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:04.160
Your Highness.

393
00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:06.430
Why don't you come to my home?

394
00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:09.310
I happen to have something for you.

395
00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:24.070
Your Highness.

396
00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:33.360
What's this?

397
00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:34.670
Do you remember

398
00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:36.040
an empty box

399
00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:37.190
in Eastern Palace?

400
00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:40.240
You said it's called Snow Mountain,

401
00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:41.830
but after getting it,

402
00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:42.790
I don't get to find

403
00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:44.070
the mountain.

404
00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:45.710
It's just a box.

405
00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:46.950
Snow Mountain

406
00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:48.830
must have melted on the way here.

407
00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:49.670
It melted?

408
00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:51.190
When I get a chance,

409
00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:52.760
I'll make it again for you.

410
00:16:58.280 --> 00:16:59.160
So this is Snow Mountain.

411
00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:00.160
Yes.

412
00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:02.000
I promised to make it

413
00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:03.240
for you.

414
00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:04.080
Therefore,

415
00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:05.600
I started making it

416
00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:07.030
when the weather was warm.

417
00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:12.120
Your Highness.

418
00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:14.120
This is delivered from the border.

419
00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:17.080
The box is kind of light.

420
00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:18.640
Could there be an insect inside?

421
00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:20.190
Shall we open it to see?

422
00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:32.400
It has nothing.

423
00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:41.190
So you didn't mean

424
00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:42.670
to scare me by sending

425
00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:44.800
Snow Mountain at that time.

426
00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:46.600
Every item that I sent

427
00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:48.190
to you

428
00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:50.270
wasn't meant to scare you.

429
00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:51.510
Were you

430
00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:53.800
scared?

431
00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:57.030
How was it possible?

432
00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:03.990
This Snow Mountain

433
00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:05.640
is a seasonal food.

434
00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:08.190
Everyone loves new things.

435
00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:09.400
No matter how good the thing is,

436
00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:10.510
it won't be favoured by the people

437
00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:11.950
if it remains the same.

438
00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:13.600
So I

439
00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:14.750
tried adding

440
00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:15.750
different spices,

441
00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:16.990
fruit jam,

442
00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:17.640
sweets, cake

443
00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:19.120
and many other ways of enjoying it.

444
00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:20.360
It could be renewed from time to time

445
00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:21.510
based on seasons and preferences.

446
00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:23.160
This is Persimmon Snow.

447
00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:24.360
I specially made this

448
00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:25.510
for you.

449
00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:26.030
I use

450
00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:27.640
persimmon kept in winter.

451
00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:28.750
The jam is made fresh.

452
00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:32.880
Try it.

453
00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:42.400
Persimmon Snow.

454
00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:57.160
If you have time,

455
00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:58.560
I also want to bother you

456
00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:00.400
to bring it to both

457
00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:01.840
Empress Dowager

458
00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:03.120
and the Third Prince to try.

459
00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:04.560
Also,

460
00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:05.800
if it's possible,

461
00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:06.920
I also want the people

462
00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:08.080
in the shop to try it.

463
00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:09.320
I think it'll boost

464
00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:11.230
the sales...

465
00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:12.880
What's wrong?

466
00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:15.880
Is cow milk added?

467
00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:16.990
I specially added it.

468
00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:25.270
Your Highness.

469
00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:27.120
Your Highness.

470
00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:33.080
What's wrong with cow milk?

471
00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:42.270
I'm not drunk.

472
00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:47.800
(Limited supply)
Stop pushing.

473
00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:48.360
Line up properly.

474
00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:49.120
Line up properly.

475
00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:49.840
One by one.

476
00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:50.320
Take it easy. Line up properly.

477
00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:51.120
Next.

478
00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:52.230
- Next.
- Here you go.

479
00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:53.710
- Here you go.
- Next.

480
00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:54.600
One for me.

481
00:19:54.670 --> 00:19:55.160
Here you go.

482
00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:56.840
How many people are in front?

483
00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:57.920
- We aren't there yet.
- Line up properly.

484
00:19:58.640 --> 00:19:59.510
It's my turn at last.

485
00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:00.660
- Next.
- Here you go.

486
00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:03.260
♪The spring breeze carries
the song away♪

487
00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:07.620
♪The mountain and river
is incomparable to you♪

488
00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:08.920
Next.

489
00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:09.710
Next.

490
00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:10.750
Give it to him.

491
00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:12.120
Minmin.

492
00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:13.800
I want to buy

493
00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:15.710
Snow Mountain later.

494
00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:16.950
If you go,

495
00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:17.430
you'll be

496
00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:18.640
my sworn enemy.

497
00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:19.950
Wait.

498
00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:22.270
Why do you hate Hua Liuli?

499
00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:24.360
I'm not even allowed
to buy Snow Mountain.

500
00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:26.230
Is it so good?

501
00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:27.880
Is our cheese cake not nice?

502
00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:28.230
No.

503
00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:29.950
I'm going back to have ten cheese cakes.

504
00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:30.990
It's nice.

505
00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:34.270
Minmin.

506
00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:38.230
(Thanks to Third Prince,)

507
00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:39.880
(I've made your painting)

508
00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:40.710
(into a banner.)

509
00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:42.120
(It's extremely effective.)

510
00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:43.950
(It's spread by word of mouth.)

511
00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:45.430
(Hua Liuli)
(Everyone says the painting)

512
00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:46.560
(is vivid and cute)

513
00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:48.320
(with its charm.)

514
00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:50.160
Princess Hua got someone

515
00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:52.560
to deliver this Snow Mountain
in a special box

516
00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:54.120
by a horse.

517
00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:55.080
Eat it

518
00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:56.360
before it melts.

519
00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:00.640
(Righteous Radiance)

520
00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:02.950
(However, I'm worried.)

521
00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:04.750
(If you dislike it,)

522
00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:05.920
(you may bother Crown Prince)

523
00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:06.880
(to relay the message.)

524
00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:08.640
(I'll withdraw it.)

525
00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:12.430
Yuanhong.

526
00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:16.840
Have you drawn another painting?

527
00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:20.160
Is this

528
00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:21.470
Hua Liuli?

529
00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:24.120
Excellent drawing skills.

530
00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:26.190
It's extremely adorable.

531
00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:29.510
What's the matter?

532
00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:32.430
I like it.

533
00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:42.430
It has to be you.

534
00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:44.510
Hua Liuli.

535
00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:51.840
Princess.

536
00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:53.120
This sunset colour

537
00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:54.750
is a new colour of
the south-western dye shop.

538
00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:56.230
They produce only two dresses.

539
00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:57.160
One has been sent

540
00:21:57.230 --> 00:21:57.950
to the palace

541
00:21:58.030 --> 00:21:59.160
as a tribute to Consort Xian.

542
00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:00.430
Another has been sent

543
00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:01.950
to our mansion.

544
00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:05.030
Look.

545
00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:06.120
This dress matches

546
00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:07.670
your favourite bangle well.

547
00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:10.360
This is it then.

548
00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:18.030
What's going on?

549
00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:19.360
The bangle...

550
00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:21.230
Have you been drinking
too much cow milk?

551
00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:22.560
You've gained weight.

552
00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:24.400
I've gained weight?

553
00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:25.710
It's you instead.

554
00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:27.160
I'm the slimmest throughout the capital.

555
00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:30.030
Use your strength, Princess.

556
00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:31.430
I'm using it.

557
00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:33.990
Princess, think about Princess Hua.

558
00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:34.670
What?

559
00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:42.190
How did you come up with this trick?

560
00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:43.990
It hurts me.

561
00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:45.880
Stupid Hua Liuli.

562
00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:48.470
Yes, Princess Hua.

563
00:22:49.030 --> 00:22:50.920
Minmin, go to the western suburb.

564
00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:52.470
Buy Snow Mountain for me.

565
00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:53.600
I'm craving for it.

566
00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:55.990
I won't go.

567
00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:00.120
Your father refused to go.

568
00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:01.880
Are you learning from him?

569
00:23:02.030 --> 00:23:04.120
I don't want to go.

570
00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:06.160
I haven't given you

571
00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:07.230
pocket money this month.

572
00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:08.430
Think properly.

573
00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:11.880
I'll go.

574
00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:13.510
Good.

575
00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:21.780
(Yunzhong Hall)

576
00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:28.030
This is what you get for helping

577
00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:29.640
Crown Prince and Hua Liuli.

578
00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:31.600
Master also let me remind you

579
00:23:31.670 --> 00:23:32.840
about

580
00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:34.030
your real master.

581
00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:35.950
If

582
00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:38.710
Hua Liuli becomes
the Ceremonial Officer,

583
00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:40.990
who...

584
00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:44.120
who will worry the most?

585
00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:45.990
Relay this message to Master.

586
00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:49.230
He'll know what to do.

587
00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:03.400
(Confidential)
Master.

588
00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:07.640
Do as Yun Han says.

589
00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:08.190
Yes.

590
00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:22.140
(Milk Tea Shop)

591
00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:40.600
Not bad.

592
00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:45.430
They're way smarter than those

593
00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:46.510
from Jinpo.

594
00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:48.430
It seems

595
00:24:48.430 --> 00:24:50.270
I should go out more often.

596
00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:52.120
Otherwise,

597
00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:54.030
they'll blame me for not
giving them a chance.

598
00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:57.600
Is it one for each?

599
00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:58.080
Yes.

600
00:24:58.470 --> 00:24:59.080
One moment, please.

601
00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:01.920
Pour more fruit jam.

602
00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:03.080
Yes, Miss.

603
00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:04.320
Red Bean.

604
00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:05.600
Why don't you wear your hat

605
00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:06.840
properly today?

606
00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:07.640
Is it skewed?

607
00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:09.120
Dressing neatly every day

608
00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:10.880
is the basic requirement of our shop.

609
00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:12.190
You should take note next time.

610
00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:13.320
Yes, Miss.

611
00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:14.600
Mung Bean.

612
00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:15.840
Miss.

613
00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:17.320
You must confirm the freshness

614
00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:18.470
of the fruits repeatedly.

615
00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:20.080
There mustn't be rotten fruits

616
00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:21.560
mixed in the jam.

617
00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:23.360
It'll affect the texture.

618
00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:24.470
Sure, Miss.

619
00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:27.510
Miss.

620
00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:28.950
You're unwell.

621
00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:30.600
Don't always work so hard.

622
00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:32.470
It's my duty.

623
00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:33.710
I've just been appointed

624
00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:34.840
as the Ceremonial Officer.

625
00:25:34.990 --> 00:25:36.270
I should do more

626
00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:37.400
for the people.

627
00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:38.600
Yuan Wei.

628
00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:39.920
Let's walk around Longjing Street.

629
00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:40.510
Sure.

630
00:25:40.670 --> 00:25:42.430
Song, we'll be heading
to Longjing Street.

631
00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:43.320
Have a safe trip.

632
00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:44.950
Let's go.

633
00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:50.620
(Longjing Street)

634
00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:54.340
(Kucha)

635
00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:56.020
(Siam)

636
00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:57.700
(Gaochang)

637
00:25:57.700 --> 00:25:59.700
(Jinpo)

638
00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:02.880
Miss.

639
00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:04.670
There's no one here.

640
00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:05.880
It's cheerless.

641
00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:07.950
Why don't we go back to the mansion?

642
00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:10.470
State ministers have yet
to arrive in the capital.

643
00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:12.470
It's surely cheerless.

644
00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:14.640
Yuan Wei.

645
00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:16.640
I'm suddenly craving

646
00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:18.160
for the plum cake on Shijin Street.

647
00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:19.880
Buy some for me.

648
00:26:20.030 --> 00:26:21.800
All right. I'm going now.

649
00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:25.400
(There're less people here.)

650
00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:27.360
(It's easier for them to act.)

651
00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:45.640
It's you.

652
00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:47.990
If you have anything

653
00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:48.640
for me,

654
00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:49.510
come to me tomorrow.

655
00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:51.120
I'm still on duty today.

656
00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:51.920
Wait.

657
00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:53.030
So what if you're on duty?

658
00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:54.430
Are you allowed to bully me?

659
00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:55.880
My mother asked me to buy

660
00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:56.710
Snow Mountain.

661
00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:58.160
The shop closed when I just arrived.

662
00:26:58.230 --> 00:26:58.920
Tell me.

663
00:26:59.230 --> 00:27:00.510
Did you deliberately ask
them to close the shop?

664
00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:02.750
Jiamin.

665
00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:04.800
You must have misunderstood me.

666
00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:06.030
We wouldn't close the shop

667
00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:07.160
for no reason.

668
00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:08.600
It must be caused by

669
00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:10.160
insufficient ingredients.

670
00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:11.360
We won't turn down

671
00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:12.470
any customer.

672
00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:16.230
How about this?

673
00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:17.670
Go back with me now.

674
00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:18.600
I'll tell them

675
00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:19.710
to specially make one for you.

676
00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:20.510
Come on.

677
00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:21.400
No.

678
00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:22.360
You must

679
00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:23.320
make it clear to me today.

680
00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:24.670
You even refuse to stay

681
00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:25.030
in the same place

682
00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:26.120
with me.

683
00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:27.840
There's a problem with this house.

684
00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:29.510
Hold your breath now.

685
00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:35.320
(You can just kill me directly.)

686
00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:36.600
(You use a drug.)

687
00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:37.880
(It seems you're up to something else.)

688
00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:40.880
(The dumb Jiamin has got in the way.)

689
00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:42.080
(I'll just turn this trick
to my own use.)

690
00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:47.360
(She's really plump.)

691
00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:53.360
Why are there two people?

692
00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:54.920
Which one is Hua Liuli?

693
00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:56.190
I can't tell which is Hua Liuli

694
00:27:56.270 --> 00:27:57.030
either.

695
00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:58.120
Time is running out.

696
00:27:58.750 --> 00:28:00.030
Forget it. Take both away.

697
00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:06.120
Guard outside.

698
00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:07.190
Don't let anyone in.

699
00:28:07.270 --> 00:28:07.670
Yes.

700
00:28:08.030 --> 00:28:08.920
Also, the two of you,

701
00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:10.400
keep an eye on the two in the house.

702
00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:10.990
Yes.

703
00:28:16.990 --> 00:28:18.920
(Judging by the travelling
time by carriage,)

704
00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:20.120
(it should've been quite a distance)

705
00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:21.120
(from the capital.)

706
00:28:24.030 --> 00:28:25.710
(It isn't difficult for me
to escape alone,)

707
00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:27.840
(but I have to seek
another chance to ensure)

708
00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:29.080
(Jiamin's safety.)

709
00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:29.880
Do you still want to run?

710
00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:40.430
Who is so ignorant?

711
00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:41.600
How dare you tie me up.

712
00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:43.230
I'll rip you apart.

713
00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:44.190
Release me!

714
00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:45.030
Do you think you can beat us?

715
00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:46.470
Don't waste your effort.

716
00:28:47.270 --> 00:28:47.710
You...

717
00:28:48.990 --> 00:28:49.840
You should wake up, too.

718
00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:52.640
Where am I?

719
00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:56.470
What's going on?

720
00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:57.430
Stay still.

721
00:28:57.800 --> 00:28:58.880
Someone has tied us up.

722
00:28:58.950 --> 00:29:00.360
Can't you see?

723
00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:02.190
Who are you?

724
00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:03.600
Why did you tie us up?

725
00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:04.920
Do you want money?

726
00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:06.190
My mother...

727
00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:07.320
Who is Princess Hua?

728
00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:10.600
Do you want to catch Hua Liuli?

729
00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:11.600
She's Hua Liuli.

730
00:29:11.670 --> 00:29:12.360
She is.

731
00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:13.160
It's her.

732
00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:13.600
She is.

733
00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:14.120
It's her.

734
00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:15.670
She's Hua Liuli.

735
00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:16.750
It really has nothing to do with me.

736
00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:17.640
It's really her.

737
00:29:17.710 --> 00:29:18.230
You...

738
00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:21.750
Why are you doing this?

739
00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:22.710
Fine.

740
00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:25.600
Since you say I am,

741
00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:27.560
I am.

742
00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:29.560
It's really her.

743
00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:31.230
Miss.

744
00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:33.710
I'm the one who you're looking for.

745
00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:35.560
Princess Hua...

746
00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:36.510
No.

747
00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:39.800
This lady is innocent.

748
00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:41.880
Let her go.

749
00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:44.640
It seems

750
00:29:45.030 --> 00:29:46.270
you're Hua Liuli instead.

751
00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:49.160
It's really her.

752
00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:51.160
You have the heart of a beast

753
00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:52.120
and you're scheming.

754
00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:52.990
Why don't you become a performer

755
00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:54.510
when you're able to act so well?

756
00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:55.990
I'm so mad.

757
00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:57.320
Let me go.

758
00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:58.950
I'm really not Hua Liuli.

759
00:29:59.030 --> 00:30:00.670
I've said it's her.

760
00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:02.470
I'll chop off your legs
if you move again!

761
00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:07.560
We'll kill you two

762
00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:08.470
if you refuse to tell.

763
00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:11.990
(It seems they don't mean)

764
00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:12.920
(to act now.)

765
00:30:13.030 --> 00:30:13.990
(They're bluffing.)

766
00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:17.670
We'll come back to you later.

767
00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:23.840
(There should be others)

768
00:30:24.030 --> 00:30:25.190
(except them.)

769
00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:28.470
Don't make any sound.

770
00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:32.640
Evil woman.

771
00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:34.030
You deliberately dragged me into this.

772
00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:35.230
You even want the assassins

773
00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:36.190
to mistake me for you.

774
00:30:36.270 --> 00:30:37.950
Use your brain.

775
00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:39.430
They're looking for me.

776
00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:41.230
Would they've spared you

777
00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:42.640
after identifying me?

778
00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:44.880
There'd only be one outcome for you.

779
00:30:46.510 --> 00:30:47.120
They will kill me

780
00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:49.120
to silence me.

781
00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:50.230
You're smart.

782
00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:51.710
So what we should do now

783
00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:53.320
is to confuse them.

784
00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:55.270
Then we'll be safe for now.

785
00:30:55.670 --> 00:30:57.600
Maybe there's a chance to be saved.

786
00:30:57.710 --> 00:30:58.670
What should we do?

787
00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:02.430
Sleep for a while.

788
00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:06.030
Don't sleep.

789
00:31:06.430 --> 00:31:07.320
Hua Liuli.

790
00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:12.840
Stay close to me.

791
00:31:13.230 --> 00:31:14.800
I'm a little scared.

792
00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:18.320
There's nothing to be scared of.

793
00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:19.120
You're so timid.

794
00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:27.470
(Ankang Garden)

795
00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:28.320
Your Highness!

796
00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:28.950
You can't enter.

797
00:31:29.030 --> 00:31:30.120
Miss has gone missing.

798
00:31:30.190 --> 00:31:31.670
Not just her.

799
00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:33.600
Princess Jiamin has also gone missing.

800
00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:41.600
Your Highness.

801
00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:42.360
This...

802
00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:44.030
This is my princess's bangle.

803
00:31:47.230 --> 00:31:47.670
Your Highness.

804
00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:48.670
This should be a kind of

805
00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:49.800
rare hypnotising drug.

806
00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:55.030
Your Highness.

807
00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:56.230
We discovered unknown blood stain

808
00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:57.600
three miles outside Longjing Street.

809
00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:01.670
Go back first.

810
00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:02.800
I'll do my best

811
00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:04.270
to look for both princesses.

812
00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:06.160
Miss has said that

813
00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:07.080
you may seem

814
00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:08.160
unfriendly to outsiders,

815
00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:09.510
but you're actually
the most reliable person.

816
00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:10.560
Your Highness.

817
00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:12.160
We can only count on you.

818
00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:20.800
Qi and Ba.

819
00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:21.470
- Yes.
- Yes.

820
00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:22.230
Jinling Garden.

821
00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:22.800
- Yes.
- Yes.

822
00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:28.700
(Yunzhong Hall)

823
00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:43.670
Your Highness.

824
00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:49.470
Deploy everyone in the capital.

825
00:32:49.670 --> 00:32:50.990
Search for Hua Liuli.

826
00:32:51.190 --> 00:32:51.600
Yes.

827
00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:52.800
Hurry up!

828
00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:53.800
Your Highness.

829
00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:54.920
Stay calm.

830
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:56.750
I know Princess Hua is very important.

831
00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:58.190
She represents the attitude
of the Hua family,

832
00:32:58.470 --> 00:32:59.470
the checks and balances
in the imperial court

833
00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:01.120
and even the situation on the frontier.

834
00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:03.600
However, she's survived

835
00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:04.880
several assassination attempts.

836
00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:06.560
She isn't as feeble as she looks.

837
00:33:06.670 --> 00:33:08.400
Maybe she has the ability
to protect herself.

838
00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:09.750
Her servant

839
00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:11.080
has even come to seek my help.

840
00:33:11.270 --> 00:33:11.880
Your Highness.

841
00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:13.320
I think we can investigate,

842
00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:15.080
but we don't have to involve
a large number of people.

843
00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:16.640
Do you remember?

844
00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:17.880
Didn't you let her come back

845
00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:19.640
to stir up a storm in the capital

846
00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:20.990
to lure the remnants of the evil consort

847
00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:22.190
who caused the battle

848
00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:22.990
with Jinpo back then?

849
00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:23.920
This

850
00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:25.230
is the best chance.

851
00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:26.950
Do you really want to give up?

852
00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:27.510
Who...

853
00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:28.360
Who can be sure

854
00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:29.470
that she won't be in danger this time?

855
00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:32.880
We've used a lot of
manpower and resources

856
00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:34.710
to weave this secret net

857
00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:35.950
covering the whole capital.

858
00:33:38.510 --> 00:33:39.800
If we use it now,

859
00:33:40.510 --> 00:33:42.600
it might be exposed thoroughly.

860
00:33:43.270 --> 00:33:44.320
Is it worth doing it

861
00:33:44.670 --> 00:33:45.640
for Hua Liuli?

862
00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:50.230
I doubted the loyalty of the Hua family.

863
00:33:52.670 --> 00:33:53.750
I tested them

864
00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:54.840
over and over again.

865
00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:58.270
However,

866
00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:02.360
I regret it very much now.

867
00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:14.990
Who are you actually?

868
00:34:15.070 --> 00:34:16.470
What do you want to do?

869
00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:17.070
Shut up.

870
00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:17.880
I'll cut your tongue

871
00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:18.950
if you talk again.

872
00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:22.470
(The woman)

873
00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:23.840
(isn't entirely evil.)

874
00:34:26.470 --> 00:34:27.800
I'll take you with me later.

875
00:34:28.630 --> 00:34:29.800
We don't have to bother about you

876
00:34:30.070 --> 00:34:31.030
after escorting you there.

877
00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:31.950
Don't worry.

878
00:34:32.110 --> 00:34:33.240
You won't be harmed for now.

879
00:34:33.630 --> 00:34:34.470
Miss.

880
00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:40.070
Are you always so assertive?

881
00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:43.680
I live a dangerous life.

882
00:34:44.070 --> 00:34:45.320
I would've died

883
00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:47.510
if I acted slowly.

884
00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:52.240
Are people living a dangerous life

885
00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:53.320
very good at

886
00:34:53.430 --> 00:34:54.630
assessing the situation?

887
00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:55.510
Of course.

888
00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:57.510
Miss.

889
00:34:57.510 --> 00:34:59.200
You're so smart

890
00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:00.630
and you can assess the situation.

891
00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:01.760
Why don't you

892
00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:02.680
consider

893
00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:03.720
working with us?

894
00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:06.550
In your dreams.

895
00:35:08.110 --> 00:35:08.760
Eat.

896
00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:17.200
Thank you, sister.

897
00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:18.550
Who is your sister?

898
00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:19.240
Wait.

899
00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:20.240
Why is our meal

900
00:35:20.430 --> 00:35:21.110
different?

901
00:35:21.550 --> 00:35:23.030
She looks thinner than you.

902
00:35:23.150 --> 00:35:24.430
She should eat more.

903
00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:28.920
Thank you, sister.

904
00:35:31.510 --> 00:35:32.320
I'm warning you.

905
00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:33.110
Don't think of escaping.

906
00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:34.550
You won't get to escape.

907
00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:39.360
Bootlicker.

908
00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:40.280
What's the point of

909
00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:40.950
licking her boot?

910
00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:42.070
What's the point of

911
00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:42.920
talking back to her then?

912
00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:49.590
I won't eat.

913
00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:50.920
Why does she bully me

914
00:35:50.990 --> 00:35:51.920
after kidnapping you?

915
00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:55.950
This is the price you have to pay

916
00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:57.680
for helping Crown Prince
and Hua Liuli.

917
00:35:58.030 --> 00:35:59.760
(Longjing Street)
Master also lets me remind you

918
00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:00.990
about

919
00:36:01.070 --> 00:36:02.200
your real master.

920
00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:07.680
I want to try to trust her.

921
00:36:08.950 --> 00:36:10.150
It's just like trusting you.

922
00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:14.460
(Blacksmith)

923
00:36:26.990 --> 00:36:28.990
Dry weather.

924
00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:31.280
Be careful with candles.

925
00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:48.280
Stop crying.

926
00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:50.510
If you're really scared,

927
00:36:51.110 --> 00:36:52.360
give me your hand.

928
00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:54.880
Who is scared?

929
00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:57.990
I think you're scared instead.

930
00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:08.760
How

931
00:37:10.070 --> 00:37:12.200
would everyone react

932
00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:14.920
when we're missing?

933
00:37:16.990 --> 00:37:19.950
My parents must be very worried.

934
00:37:22.070 --> 00:37:23.590
Come on, dear.

935
00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:24.950
I travelled

936
00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:26.360
two streets

937
00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:27.400
to buy this.

938
00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:28.430
Try it.

939
00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:36.070
You've finally found my favourite food.

940
00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:39.470
Master and Madam.

941
00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:41.470
I've gone to houses where the princess

942
00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:42.470
often visits.

943
00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:43.200
She isn't there.

944
00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:44.320
Neither is Hong.

945
00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:46.510
Go to the music workshop.

946
00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:47.920
Who would dare to catch

947
00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:48.920
someone like Jiamin?

948
00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:51.680
Come on.

949
00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:53.030
Try this, too.

950
00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:54.920
This is also delicious.

951
00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:57.470
What do you think?

952
00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:05.110
You have no relative

953
00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:07.030
in the capital.

954
00:38:07.630 --> 00:38:09.360
Would no one worry about you?

955
00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:14.280
There may be someone.

956
00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:16.360
Who is it?

957
00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:20.400
I don't know.

958
00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:22.320
Maybe no one

959
00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:23.760
would even care

960
00:38:24.070 --> 00:38:25.590
when we're missing

961
00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:27.280
for a night.

962
00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:32.070
Speaking of that,

963
00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:34.590
I don't know

964
00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:36.070
if he'd worry about me.

965
00:38:39.590 --> 00:38:40.510
Don't worry.

966
00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:42.320
I'll keep you safe.

967
00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:51.630
(All assassins sent from Jinpo)

968
00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:52.680
(have been arrested.)

969
00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:54.400
(Almost all moles)

970
00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:55.280
(lurking beside me)

971
00:38:55.590 --> 00:38:56.800
(have been removed.)

972
00:38:57.430 --> 00:38:58.430
(Still, there's someone)

973
00:38:58.510 --> 00:39:00.110
(who's targeting Hua Liuli.)

974
00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:02.030
(I must have missed something.)

975
00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:05.720
(Who could be)

976
00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:07.880
(the mastermind?)

977
00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:09.840
Ba.

978
00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:10.840
Yes.

979
00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:12.320
Go to Junior Secretary Pei.

980
00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:13.200
Ask him to find a way

981
00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:14.720
to make A'Wa reveal

982
00:39:15.070 --> 00:39:16.070
whether or not Jinpo

983
00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:17.240
still has other people in the capital.

984
00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:17.920
Yes.

985
00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:20.150
(Liuli.)

986
00:39:21.110 --> 00:39:22.590
(I'll keep you safe.)

987
00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:24.510
I've observed in general.

988
00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:25.990
There's no place

989
00:39:26.070 --> 00:39:27.280
as broken as this in the capital.

990
00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:28.630
Even the broken temple

991
00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:29.760
near the western suburb

992
00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:31.070
is way cleaner than this place.

993
00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:32.840
So I think

994
00:39:33.110 --> 00:39:33.760
this is either

995
00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:35.030
the border suburb of the capital

996
00:39:35.150 --> 00:39:35.880
or

997
00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:37.240
out of the capital.

998
00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:41.630
Think of a way to escape

999
00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:43.240
before leaving the capital.

1000
00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:44.360
I'll cover you up.

1001
00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:46.800
Find someone to save me after that.

1002
00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:48.510
You?

1003
00:39:50.070 --> 00:39:51.360
Can you make it?

1004
00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:52.920
Why not?

1005
00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:54.150
I'm not as feeble and useless

1006
00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:55.150
like you.

1007
00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:57.550
I study military tactics

1008
00:39:57.630 --> 00:39:58.800
and practise martial arts

1009
00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:00.150
from five years old.

1010
00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:03.990
I want to save you

1011
00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:05.720
for General Wei and the few

1012
00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:06.990
slices of meat just now.

1013
00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:09.150
I know.

1014
00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:10.400
Your whole family

1015
00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:12.470
has great respect for my mother.

1016
00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:14.510
Be honest with me.

1017
00:40:15.070 --> 00:40:16.400
Are you jealous of me?

1018
00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:18.030
I'm not.

1019
00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:22.400
It's useless even if
you're jealous of me.

1020
00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:24.680
My father, mother

1021
00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:25.240
and brother

1022
00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:26.680
pamper me very much.

1023
00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:28.030
They always tell me

1024
00:40:28.110 --> 00:40:28.920
that I am the world's

1025
00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:29.950
best daughter.

1026
00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:33.880
I just feel sorry

1027
00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:34.990
for General Wei.

1028
00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:36.880
She's the best of women.

1029
00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:38.840
Having a scheming

1030
00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:39.760
and pretentious daughter

1031
00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:41.200
is the only failure in her life.

1032
00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:42.470
You know what?

1033
00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:44.510
The more Xi Shi clutched her chest,

1034
00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:46.320
the more beautiful she looked.

1035
00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:47.590
It talks about

1036
00:40:47.630 --> 00:40:48.720
people like me.

1037
00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:50.240
Gentle and sickly.

1038
00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:51.920
I'll leave a reputation for ages.

1039
00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:55.200
What a great cause.

1040
00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:02.800
Someone is coming.

1041
00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:08.740
(Pretentious Hour)

1042
00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:12.150
What would you like to have

1043
00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:13.510
tonight, Your Highness?

1044
00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:16.430
Biangbiang noodles.

1045
00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:18.800
I beg your pardon.

1046
00:41:20.630 --> 00:41:21.720
Biangbiang noodles.

1047
00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:23.760
Why?

1048
00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:25.880
Does my chef not know how to make it?

1049
00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:30.400
I'll be right back.

1050
00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:36.070
Your Highness.

1051
00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:37.200
Here it is.

1052
00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:44.430
Your Highness, try it now.

1053
00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:45.920
What's this?

1054
00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:48.680
It's Goodgood noodles.

1055
00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:50.200
Two "good".

1056
00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:51.150
Isn't it good?

1057
00:41:52.150 --> 00:41:53.280
Yes, it is.

1058
00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:57.420
