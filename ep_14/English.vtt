=Episode 14=

17
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.640
Ten years ago,

18
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:43.760
there was a battle

19
00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.310
called the Battle of Yuncang Ridge.

20
00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.360
I wonder if you have ever heard of it.

21
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.280
What does it have to do with me?

22
00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.560
It was only a few years afterwards

23
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.390
that I came to my senses.

24
00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.150
In that battle,

25
00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:59.760
the State of Jin suffered great damage

26
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.480
and Jinpo was also shattered.

27
00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.200
So it was a toss-up.

28
00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.760
I've looked deeper

29
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:10.510
and found a very interesting man

30
00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.710
who is so ambitious

31
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.080
that he could hurt the foundations

32
00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.760
of two states with a single battle.

33
00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.040
What are you trying to say,

34
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.200
the second prince of Jinpo?

35
00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.110
You've been following
the orders of that man

36
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.080
to lurk around the Crown Prince

37
00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.600
for ten years,

38
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.360
without ever being discovered.

39
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.640
You are so impressive

40
00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.160
that you make me want to make friends,

41
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.550
or else

42
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.080
I would not have let you

43
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.640
leave this place alive.

44
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.760
Make friends?

45
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.040
Yes.

46
00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.950
I want to befriend

47
00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.790
your master.

48
00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.110
I wonder if I have the honour.

49
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.110
Looks like

50
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.950
you are going to disappoint me.

51
00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.000
Split up!

52
00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:08.440
(No.)

53
00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:10.830
(I can't go back to
the capital at this moment.)

54
00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:12.300
(I have to)

55
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.460
(find a place to hide for now.)

56
00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.300
(Du Mansion)

57
00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.700
(Grand Preceptor Mansion)

58
00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:42.470
Who's there?

59
00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:45.800
Young Master Yun.

60
00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:47.830
Young Master Yun, what's going on?

61
00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:49.710
Why are you bleeding so much?

62
00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:50.390
Lady Du.

63
00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:00.350
Miss.

64
00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:01.080
Is there

65
00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:02.080
anything else you need?

66
00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:04.320
Go and get some ointment.

67
00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:06.510
I just cut my hand.

68
00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:07.640
Should I call the physician?

69
00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:08.910
No need.

70
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.350
I can handle it myself.

71
00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.880
For the next few days,
I'll be in seclusion.

72
00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:14.150
No one is allowed to come in.

73
00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:15.760
- Yes, Miss.
- Yes, Miss.

74
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.760
Is she really okay?

75
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:20.950
I don't know either.

76
00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:41.030
We must do good rather than evil,

77
00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.640
on however humble a scale.

78
00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.150
Du Xiuying.

79
00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:46.710
This is life and death.

80
00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:49.350
His life is at stake.
It must not be delayed.

81
00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:08.880
This is what I have been

82
00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:10.030
preparing all these days.

83
00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:12.910
Jinling Garden is temporarily closed

84
00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:14.440
for the reception

85
00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:15.590
of the envoys.

86
00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:17.150
The construction of Longjing Street

87
00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.440
is almost complete

88
00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:19.880
and the rest of the work

89
00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:21.270
is in the charge of Princess Hua.

90
00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:22.680
There are no shortcomings.

91
00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:25.350
Good. I'm very relieved

92
00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:26.710
to entrust you two with this.

93
00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:29.760
The envoy meeting is coming soon.

94
00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:32.350
I have also summoned Hua Yingting

95
00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:33.200
and the others back.

96
00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:34.640
They should come

97
00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:36.680
and witness such a great event.

98
00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:37.800
The family

99
00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.350
will also be reunited at last.

100
00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:42.760
However,

101
00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:46.350
are you really not going to consider

102
00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.270
Du's granddaughter?

103
00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:49.830
Father.

104
00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:52.320
As I said before,

105
00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:53.240
I promised

106
00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.150
that I would find

107
00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:55.470
someone I like.

108
00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:57.080
Lady Du is not the right person.

109
00:07:58.030 --> 00:07:59.240
Someone you like?

110
00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:01.240
Then make haste.

111
00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:05.320
Yuansu.

112
00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:08.000
I was surrounded by people

113
00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:09.640
when I was your age.

114
00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:12.240
You are my beloved son,

115
00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:14.800
a man of great skill and talent.

116
00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.270
There are so many
young ladies in the capital,

117
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:17.640
but you...

118
00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:18.200
Father.

119
00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:20.390
I suddenly remember

120
00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:22.080
that I have something to do.

121
00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:24.880
I'll take my leave.

122
00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:27.350
Wait.

123
00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:29.320
I haven't finished yet. You...

124
00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:31.350
Your Majesty.

125
00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.590
Today seems to be Shangsi Festival.

126
00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:37.560
So perhaps His Highness
misses his mother.

127
00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:43.160
I see.

128
00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:46.200
My bad.

129
00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:49.400
I'm not a good father.

130
00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:58.080
Are you going back to Eastern Palace?

131
00:08:58.350 --> 00:08:59.080
To the Flower God Temple.

132
00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:14.100
(Flower God Temple)

133
00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:32.520
(Mother.)

134
00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:34.350
(The State of Jin)

135
00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.520
(is now peaceful and prosperous.)

136
00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.200
(I pray that you will not)

137
00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:40.830
(devote yourself to a royal
family in your next life.)

138
00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:44.830
(Marrying into an ordinary family)

139
00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:47.560
(and living together for a lifetime)

140
00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:49.080
(is also happiness.)

141
00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:51.630
(Mother.)

142
00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:54.400
(May your spirit in heaven)

143
00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:58.080
(can bless father with good health.)

144
00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:01.160
(Although father was
not a good husband,)

145
00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.400
(he is a good Emperor.)

146
00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:05.630
(He can do so much)

147
00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:07.230
(for the people,)

148
00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:09.320
(which your son)

149
00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:11.680
(may not be able to accomplish.)

150
00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:20.680
(Flower God Temple)

151
00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:21.560
(Flower God Temple)
Princess Hua is here.

152
00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:22.630
(Flower God Temple)

153
00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:23.800
(Flower God Temple)
Princess Hua, you are here.

154
00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:24.750
Are you here to pay respect?

155
00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:25.590
Yes.

156
00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:28.320
Your Highness.

157
00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:29.160
Princess Hua?

158
00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.280
Your Highness.

159
00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:33.560
Why are you here?

160
00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:37.830
I'm here to pray for my mother.

161
00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:40.280
Today is the Shangsi Festival.

162
00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.680
That's why I came.

163
00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:43.710
You're not familiar with the area.

164
00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.470
I'll lead the way for you.

165
00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:47.800
Thank you, Your Highness.

166
00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:55.620
(Flower God Temple)

167
00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:02.920
Yuan Wei.

168
00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:04.710
Go and light some more lanterns.

169
00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:05.320
All right.

170
00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:22.750
The harsh climate in Qinghan Prefecture

171
00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:24.440
is not suitable for growing crops.

172
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:25.560
You must have

173
00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:26.630
suffered a lot

174
00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:28.520
staying there all these years.

175
00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:32.230
Although it can't be
compared with the capital.

176
00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:34.230
I did not

177
00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:36.040
suffer much growing up.

178
00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:37.750
I'm the youngest in my family.

179
00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:40.080
So they adore me.

180
00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:41.680
Moreover,

181
00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:42.400
I'm the daughter

182
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:43.750
of two great generals.

183
00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:44.830
So the people

184
00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:46.630
are very close to me.

185
00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:50.040
I am the Crown Prince.

186
00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:51.280
You should be

187
00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:52.280
complaining to me about

188
00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:53.830
how miserable Qinghan Prefecture is

189
00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:54.800
and how hard it was

190
00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:56.280
for you growing up

191
00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:56.800
so that

192
00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:58.520
I can respect the Hua family even more.

193
00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:00.470
It's because you're the Crown Prince

194
00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:02.920
that I don't want to flatter

195
00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:04.160
or lie.

196
00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:06.630
What about you?

197
00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:07.870
What do you mean?

198
00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:10.400
Why are you here?

199
00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:16.110
I came to pay respect

200
00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:17.440
for the deceased

201
00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:19.400
and pray for her happiness
in the next life.

202
00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:22.680
That's all

203
00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:25.110
I can do for her.

204
00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:27.280
(Is she)

205
00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:29.160
(the one whom)

206
00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:30.280
(His Highness loves?)

207
00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:33.520
Your Highness, give me your hand.

208
00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:42.040
What is this?

209
00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:45.280
I heard a story

210
00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:45.950
from old people

211
00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:47.230
in Qinghan Prefecture.

212
00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:48.830
It is said that there is a butterfly

213
00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:50.080
in the underworld

214
00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:51.680
that can bring

215
00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:52.920
lost souls back.

216
00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:54.800
It can also help
the living to bring a message

217
00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:56.680
to those who are important to them.

218
00:12:58.230 --> 00:12:59.200
Your Highness,

219
00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:01.230
put this butterfly
under your pillow tonight

220
00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:02.590
and maybe

221
00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:04.320
she'll hear you.

222
00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:07.680
Thank you.

223
00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:10.520
I'll take you to release the lanterns.

224
00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:11.680
This is our customary activity

225
00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:12.950
during the festival.

226
00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:13.830
Sure.

227
00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:21.080
(May my grandfather live a long life.)
(May my brother pass the exam.)

228
00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:22.830
His Highness has gone to
the Flower God Temple.

229
00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:25.680
We can finally release the lanterns.

230
00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:27.680
What did you wish for?

231
00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:29.440
I wish grandfather good health

232
00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:30.520
and a long life.

233
00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:32.800
I wish my brother
passed the entrance exam.

234
00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:34.800
And I wish

235
00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:36.400
I can meet someone I like.

236
00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:37.680
What did you wish for?

237
00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:40.280
I haven't thought about it yet.

238
00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:42.680
Don't you always wish

239
00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:44.350
that the person you like will like you?

240
00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:45.990
Why don't you wish that this year?

241
00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:52.230
Slow down.

242
00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:53.040
It's so pretty.

243
00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:54.440
Don't trip.

244
00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:10.040
Your Highness.

245
00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:11.590
Do you know

246
00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:13.110
what we do at the border

247
00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:16.520
when it's a festival?

248
00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:17.750
Offer worship?

249
00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.080
We hold a joke-telling competition.

250
00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:23.560
Everyone will tell their greatest joy

251
00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:25.200
during the year.

252
00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:26.710
Come on.

Keep going.

Fill your glass.

256
00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:31.750
Here.

257
00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:32.520
Pour the liquor.

258

What is your greatest joy this year?

263
00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:43.200
Isn't it obvious?

264
00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:44.680
Of course it's when we won the war,

265
00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:45.230
isn't it?

266
00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:46.800
That's also the greatest joy for us.

267
00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:47.560

268
00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:48.680

- Yes.
- Yes.

271
00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:53.750
One time, he made a bet with me

272
00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:55.630
on which of us would
finish shower first.

273
00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:56.680
The loser

274
00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:57.440
would call the other one

275
00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:58.950
"big brother" for a year.

276
00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:00.110
And guess what?

277
00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:02.040
I finished my shower first.

278
00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:03.380
He was too fat.

279
00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:04.900

to wash the whole body.

A'Zu is gone.

286
00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:18.080
He's dead.

287

You're the one who's crazy.

330
00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:23.110

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:29.910
Yes.

335
00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:31.150
Who would bother with him?

336
00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:32.720
Mother asked me to come

337
00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:33.830
and pray for marriage.

338
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:34.560
Then I happened to

339
00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:36.240
see Princess Hua's carriage.

340
00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:37.590
I'm guessing

341
00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:39.630
Princess Jiamin is jealous.

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:43.520
Yes.

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:45.240

348
00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:55.350
A noble lady

349
00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:56.350
should not say such things.

350
00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:58.080
Xiuying, I've had enough.

351
00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:00.110

00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:03.760
What's wrong with her?

353
00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:06.480
Perhaps Yun Han has betrayed her trust.

354
00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:08.240
Jinling Garden is closed
down just like that.

355
00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:09.080
We've spent

356
00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:10.280

357
00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:11.190
This is too much.

358
00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:12.630
Don't you agree, Xiuying?

359
00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:19.040

366
00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:50.350
Let go of the past?

367
00:18:58.630 --> 00:19:00.960
Mother.

368
00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:29.520
Your Highness.

369
00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:32.350

It's already a quarter past nine.

375
00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:10.080
I woke up so late today.

376
00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:12.150

378
00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:15.280
Forget it. You may leave.

379
00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:16.240
I want to get changed.

380
00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:17.670
Yes, Your Highness.

381
00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:39.760
I mean,

382
00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:41.960
why did you come to me again?

383
00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:42.800
Didn't you

384
00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:44.110
put up lanterns last night?

385
00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:46.720
Why is a Ceremonial Officer so idle?

386
00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:49.190
Everyone is not around.

387
00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:50.560
So I came to hang out with you

388
00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:51.830
when I have time.

389
00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:54.320
No need.

390
00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:55.280
Now everyone thinks

391
00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:56.590
I saved you.

392
00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:58.480
My father was even impeached.

393
00:20:59.000 --> 00:20:59.720
Gosh.

394
00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:01.190
We are now

395
00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:03.280
best friends through thick and thin.

396
00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:05.560
Besides, you saved me.

397
00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:07.720
Then it's only right

398
00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:09.390
that I thank you.

399
00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:10.590
Yes.

400
00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:12.110
My father deserved

401
00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:13.350
to be impeached.

402
00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:16.000
Jiamin, my best friend.

403
00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:17.190
I've brought you

404
00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:19.630
a gift this time.

405
00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:23.670
I don't want to eat beef jerky anymore.

406
00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:25.590
I'm losing my teeth.

407
00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:27.830
It's not beef jerky.

408
00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:31.760
Look. Do you like it?

409
00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:32.720
I made this

410
00:21:32.910 --> 00:21:34.830
especially for you.

411
00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:36.910
It's the one and only in the capital.

412
00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:38.520
Really?

413
00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:40.630
I don't deserve this.

414
00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:42.350
I didn't really save you.

415
00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:43.670
I can't accept it.

416
00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:45.150
I know you like it.

417
00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:46.240
Take it.

418
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.760
How do you know I like it?

419
00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:49.800
Didn't you

420
00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:51.240
ask your servant girl to come to me

421
00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:52.320
with a fake gourd

422
00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:53.630
for redemption last time?

423
00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:56.240
Also, this is

424
00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:58.150
made based on your looks.

425
00:21:58.280 --> 00:21:59.910
If you don't accept it,

426
00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:01.190
I'll just throw it.

427
00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:01.670
No.

428
00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:02.910
I'll take it.

429
00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:05.520
Tell me.

430
00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:07.110
On account of the doll,

431
00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:08.480
I'll do you a favour.

432
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.040
It's not really a big deal.

433
00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:15.000
I just want to ask you something.

434
00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:15.350
All right.

435
00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:17.150
You grew up in the capital

436
00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:18.630
and are a member of the royal family.

437
00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:21.040
Then do you know

438
00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:23.830
which lady

439
00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:25.910
the Crown Prince is close to?

440
00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:27.760
The Crown Prince

441
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.280
and a lady?

442
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.190
Isn't that you?

443
00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:49.910
(Welcoming the return of Hua Yingting)
Leave this to the officials

444
00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:50.910
(and Wei Mingyue)
in the capital.

445
00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:51.870
Tell them to follow

446
00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:53.190
the details written above.

447
00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:55.520
No shortfall allowed.

448
00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:56.590
Yes, Your Highness.

449
00:22:57.150 --> 00:22:58.040
It's a matter of great importance

450
00:22:58.390 --> 00:22:59.430
that must be handled with care.

451
00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:00.800
Yes, Your Highness.

452
00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:08.350
Yun Han has not yet returned

453
00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:09.830
from an errand.

454
00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:11.760
Hua Liuli

455
00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:13.240
is unable to get away

456
00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:15.590
because of the envoy meeting.

457
00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:19.190
Ba.

458
00:23:19.910 --> 00:23:20.630
After Pei Jihuai

459
00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:21.670
completed his part,

460
00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:22.910
find a reason

461
00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:24.150
to let him out tonight.

462
00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:25.000
Yes, Your Highness.

463
00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:32.080
I mean

464
00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:34.760
that kind of closeness.

465
00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:36.480
Which kind?

466
00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:39.760
It's the kind of closeness you have

467
00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:40.760
with Prince Ying.

468
00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:42.520
Me and Prince Ying?

469
00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:43.630
We're not close.

470
00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:44.830
If you make it up again, I'll leave.

471
00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:46.040
Fine.

472
00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:47.350
No more talk about you.

473
00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:49.280
Let's get back to His Highness.

474
00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:53.430
Then have you heard of

475
00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:55.390
any woman

476
00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:56.910
that His Highness has in mind?

477
00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:58.560
I still think it's you.

478
00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:00.670
Aren't you and His Highness

479
00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:01.870
secretly flirting with each other,

480
00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:03.000
exchanging glances,

481
00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:03.870
sharing secrets

482
00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.000
and in cahoots with each other?

483
00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:06.190
We all know that.

484
00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:08.000
And you did this

485
00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:09.390
at the gate of the city.

486
00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:12.190
Jiamin.

487
00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.910
You are so talented.

488
00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:15.800
You speak

489
00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:17.190
so many beautiful words.

490
00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:19.000
(Oh, no.)

491
00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:21.280
(Why did I slip up all of a sudden?)

492
00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:23.110
(I'm not going to be killed, am I?)

493
00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:25.520
Is there any woman

494
00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:28.000
other than me

495
00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:30.110
who has any connection
with His Highness?

496
00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:32.670
It's only you.

497
00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:35.000
I told you, except me.

498
00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:36.320
Think again.

499
00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:39.870
What other features does she have?

500
00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:46.000
She was pretty,

501
00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:48.150
educated

502
00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:49.910
and the kind of person

503
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.150
you couldn't forget at first sight.

504
00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:52.520
Oh, yes.

505
00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:54.720
She was delicate

506
00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:58.000
and died at
young age due to illness.

507
00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:00.800
Do you mean delicate like you?

508
00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:06.040
Maybe a little more delicate than me.

509
00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:09.430
Let me see.

510
00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:12.280
There are indeed ladies

511
00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:15.040
who have died young
in the past two years,

512
00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:18.830
but in terms of beauty and fragility,

513
00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:20.910
they are not comparable to you.

514
00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:26.350
There is one person

515
00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:28.080
with features that are
particularly like yours.

516
00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:32.150
She was not from the capital.

517
00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:34.110
She is the eldest daughter of

518
00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:36.150
Princess Le Yang
and Master Xie, Xie Chan.

519
00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:38.280
Xie Chan

520
00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:39.560
was quite pretty

521
00:25:40.350 --> 00:25:42.040
and educated.

522
00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:44.720
However, she grew up in poor health

523
00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:45.560
and became dependent
on medication.

524
00:25:45.910 --> 00:25:47.350
She died two years ago.

525
00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:50.240
That's a pity.

526
00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:52.520
Then has she been to the capital?

527
00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:54.350
Of course.

528
00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:55.430
Princess Le Yang

529
00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:56.720
brought them to the capital

530
00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:57.910
for two months every year.

531
00:25:58.870 --> 00:25:59.280
She seemed

532
00:25:59.350 --> 00:26:00.870
to have fallen ill in the capital.

533
00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:02.910
All the physicians came,

534
00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:04.080
but failed to save her.

535
00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:07.760
However, she did grow close

536
00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:09.560
to His Highness

537
00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:10.560
when she was in the capital.

538
00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:14.320
I see.

539
00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:18.870
I got it.

540
00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:24.240
(Could that Xie Chan)

541
00:26:24.670 --> 00:26:25.830
(be the one His Highness)

542
00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:27.240
(can't stop thinking about?)

543
00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:30.820
(Ambitious)

544
00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:38.590
Miss.

545
00:26:39.150 --> 00:26:40.960
Time to wash up and go to bed.

546
00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:45.080
Why do you suddenly

547
00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:46.520
start practising calligraphy?

548
00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.590
I read today that

549
00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:50.910
practising calligraphy is
the best way for self-cultivation.

550
00:26:51.670 --> 00:26:52.430
It will help me to develop

551
00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:54.000
the temperament of a delicate woman.

552
00:26:55.910 --> 00:26:56.480
Look.

553
00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:57.580
(Temperament)

554
00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:58.560
How is my handwriting?

555
00:27:00.150 --> 00:27:01.350
This word

556
00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:03.520
really fits your temperament.

557
00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:09.630
Miss.

558
00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:11.190
Miss.

559
00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:12.390
I have a question.

560
00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:14.630
Did you

561
00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:17.480
knit a little animal for His Highness?

562
00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:19.080
Yes.

563
00:27:19.670 --> 00:27:21.150
Your father used to

564
00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:22.960
make these little stuff
to your mother.

565
00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:24.280
You're better than him.

566
00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:25.670
Not only do you make little animals,

567
00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:26.870
you make up little stories.

568
00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:28.670
So what?

569
00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:31.430
He's got a sweetheart.

570
00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:35.960
A sweetheart?

571
00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:39.220
Miss, what do you mean?

572
00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:42.100
(Tianzi Number Five)

573
00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:45.910
Come out.

574
00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:47.720
It's time to hit the road.

575
00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:49.560
Where are you going?

576
00:27:49.670 --> 00:27:50.590
Take me along.

577
00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:51.590
I don't know.

578
00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:52.800
I'm just following orders.

579
00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:53.670
You...

580
00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:55.520
General.

581
00:27:56.830 --> 00:27:58.320
Don't defend me anymore.

582
00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:01.520
I don't know

583
00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:04.560
when we'll see each other again.

584
00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:07.280
We, Jin people, often say,

585
00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:09.720
"Riding on the same boat
requires a decade of cultivation."

586
00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:10.670
I know.

587
00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:13.280
How fortunate it is that we have met

588
00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:15.080
and spent so much time together

589
00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:16.430
in this one cell.

590
00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:19.590
We eat together every day,

591
00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:20.830
we talk about anything

592
00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:22.430
and we spend every moment

593
00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:24.000
of day and night...

594
00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:26.520
General A'Wa.

595
00:28:28.150 --> 00:28:29.560
See you in the next life.

596
00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:31.320
Brother.

597
00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:35.630
Everyone will die someday.

598
00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:37.110
It's just a matter

599
00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:38.110
of time.

600
00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:39.520
This time you die first.

601
00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:42.040
A crippled soldier like me

602
00:28:42.670 --> 00:28:43.870
won't last long.

603
00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:45.830
Wait for me in the afterlife.

604
00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:50.110
Brother.

605
00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:51.390
Brother.

606
00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:54.520
I'll go first.

607
00:28:59.110 --> 00:29:00.080
Brother.

608
00:29:00.390 --> 00:29:02.000
I will miss you.

609
00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:11.760
Eat slowly. No one is rushing you.

610
00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:15.630
I also want to drink
Princess Hua's milk tea.

611
00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:16.350
Go ahead.

612
00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:17.280
Thank you, Your Highness.

613
00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:18.670
I heard

614
00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:19.150
there is

615
00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:20.080
a nice place around here

616
00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:21.110
called Qingyun Bar.

617
00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:21.960
I don't care.

618
00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:23.000
You must take me there.

619
00:29:23.150 --> 00:29:23.870
Sure.

620
00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:27.110
And Fafa.

621
00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:28.240
I haven't seen Fafa for a long time.

622
00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:29.080
I miss it.

623
00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:29.960
Sure.

624
00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:31.800
So

625
00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:33.760
what did you find out?

626
00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:37.350
I'll tell you all about it

627
00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:38.720
when I've had enough to eat and drink.

628
00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:48.000
Did you find out

629
00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:49.870
the most important things?

630
00:29:57.760 --> 00:29:58.590
There were

631
00:29:58.590 --> 00:29:59.830
more than five assassins
between our state

632
00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:01.320
and Jinpo.

633
00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:03.080
The spies

634
00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:04.670
were so well hidden

635
00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:05.910
that even A'Wa

636
00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:07.110
didn't know who they were.

637
00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:08.960
Well, that

638
00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:10.430
didn't surprise me.

639
00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:13.630
What about the other thing?

640
00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:16.190
What else?

641
00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:20.240
Think again.

642
00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:30.560
I think that's all,

643
00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:31.320
Your Highness.

644
00:30:33.670 --> 00:30:34.670
Hua Liuli.

645
00:30:37.150 --> 00:30:38.040
What exactly is

646
00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:38.760
Hua Liuli's involvement

647
00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:40.630
with the second prince of Jinpo?

648
00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:45.040
Your Highness.

649
00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:47.720
Do you need me to find out

650
00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:49.350
the relationship between
the second prince Jinpo

651
00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:50.320
and Princess Hua?

652
00:30:50.910 --> 00:30:51.830
Then you will have

653
00:30:51.910 --> 00:30:53.040
a great deal of leverage

654
00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:54.190
over Princess Hua.

655
00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:56.000
Then she will surely

656
00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:57.280
obey you.

657
00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:02.000
I thought you said
you didn't care about it.

658
00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:39.830
Yuan Wei.

659
00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:41.560
Come and help me.

660
00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:42.800
Coming.

661
00:31:44.670 --> 00:31:46.670
Okay. One, two, three.

662
00:31:50.390 --> 00:31:51.040
Let me do it.

663
00:31:54.590 --> 00:31:56.430
These were from the Empress Dowager.

664
00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:59.630
These were from His Highness.

665
00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:01.040
Which one looks better?

666
00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:02.480
I must pick the best one

667
00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:04.350
and wear it to meet
my parents and brothers.

668
00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:10.080
I haven't picked out a dress yet.

669
00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:11.390
Yes.

670
00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:12.830
I will wear the one

671
00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:13.870
that Her Highness gave me.

672
00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:14.520
Yes.

673
00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:15.590
I want to wear the most vibrant one.

674
00:32:15.670 --> 00:32:16.960
Okay, I'll get it.

675
00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:22.280
This isn't the right look

676
00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:24.190
to meet my parents.

677
00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:25.560
I need to change my makeup.

678
00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:26.480
Let's go.

679
00:32:31.630 --> 00:32:33.430
Miss, I've never seen you

680
00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:34.630
so nervous before.

681
00:32:34.670 --> 00:32:35.630
Of course.

682
00:32:35.670 --> 00:32:37.390
I haven't seen my
parents for a long time.

683
00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:40.080
Where is Mister Song?

684
00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:41.830
- Uncle Song?
- Uncle Song.

685
00:32:41.910 --> 00:32:43.320
Have you prepared yet?

686
00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:45.080
Coming, Miss.

687
00:32:46.830 --> 00:32:48.630
I've long prepared.

688
00:32:49.870 --> 00:32:51.760
Uncle Song, you...

689
00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:55.630
General will be here today.

690
00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:56.590
We mustn't

691
00:32:56.670 --> 00:32:58.080
disgrace General Hua.

692
00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:02.190
He called us here

693
00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:03.110
so early today.

694
00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:07.630
Let's go.

695
00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:10.350
Your Highness, are we leaving now?

696
00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.150
The last time we greeted Princess Hua,

697
00:33:14.190 --> 00:33:15.280
he didn't even move after a long delay.

698
00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:16.630
He is so early today.

699
00:33:18.150 --> 00:33:19.080
Do you have any complaints?

700
00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:19.960
No.

701
00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:21.110
- Your Highness, please.
- Your Highness, please.

702
00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:23.280
(Righteous Radiance)

703
00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:23.870
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

704
00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:27.150
Let's go.

705
00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:47.040
Is that Princess Hua's carriage?

706
00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:48.110
Yes, Your Highness.

707
00:33:48.390 --> 00:33:49.630
Then we will stop here

708
00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:51.320
and wait for General Hua.

709
00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:52.430
Yes, Your Highness.

710
00:33:54.430 --> 00:33:56.960
Are we going to receive them here?

711
00:33:57.430 --> 00:34:00.720
This is contrary to etiquette.

712
00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:03.390
Then go and talk to His Highness.

713
00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:04.560
Me?

714
00:34:04.670 --> 00:34:05.960
Why don't you go instead?

715
00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:07.080
Perhaps

716
00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:09.190
this is his intention.

717
00:34:09.310 --> 00:34:10.270
His Highness

718
00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:11.750
has His Majesty's backing.

719
00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:13.750
But...

720
00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:15.920
Your Highness, are we really

721
00:34:16.110 --> 00:34:17.230
going to greet them here?

722
00:34:17.710 --> 00:34:19.880
I don't care what they think.

723
00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:21.920
(I'll let you have some time)

724
00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.360
(for the reunion.)

725
00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:27.820
(The Capital)

726
00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:29.750
Miss.

727
00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:30.360
The Empress Dowager

728
00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:31.710
has granted you so many dresses,

729
00:34:32.150 --> 00:34:33.670
but you chose a bright red one.

730
00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:34.630
Those who don't know

731
00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:36.190
would think you are getting married.

732
00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:38.520
Red is good.

733
00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:41.920
It's so vibrant and appealing.

734
00:34:42.630 --> 00:34:43.710
Then my parents

735
00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:45.150
can see me at a glance.

736
00:34:47.670 --> 00:34:49.080
I remember when I was a child,

737
00:34:50.110 --> 00:34:51.920
whenever my parents went to war,

738
00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.840
I would stand on the city wall

739
00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:56.150
and wait for them to return.

740
00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:09.840
Miss.

741
00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:12.110
You've been waiting for three days.

742
00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:14.110
Go back and rest.

743
00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:15.080
Come down.

744
00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.190
Uncle Song.

745
00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:24.630
Will my parents and brother come back?

746
00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:27.960
I heard

747
00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:30.520
there was a situation

748
00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:32.840
with the rations on the road this time

749
00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:35.400
and they couldn't be delivered in time.

750
00:35:36.590 --> 00:35:38.040
A soldier's vocation

751
00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.520
is to guard the gate of the nation.

752
00:35:42.190 --> 00:35:43.670
War is cruel.

753
00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:46.920
You have to

754
00:35:47.590 --> 00:35:48.400
be prepared for the fact that

755
00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:49.520
we can't always win.

756
00:35:58.710 --> 00:36:00.000
I know.

757
00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:02.920
I wish my parents

758
00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:05.790
don't have to leave this time.

759
00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:10.750
Miss.

760
00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:11.960
There they are!

761
00:36:27.590 --> 00:36:29.000
It's the Hua family army.

762
00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:31.000
They are finally triumphant.

763
00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:32.150
This is

764
00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:33.920
the core of the Hua family army.

765
00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:40.710
(Qinghan Prefecture)
Father, mother!

766
00:36:41.110 --> 00:36:43.960
Father, mother!

767
00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:46.230
Mother, it's Liuli.

768
00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:48.080
(The Capital)
Father, mother!

769
00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:51.750
Master, Madam.

770
00:36:52.750 --> 00:36:54.040
Liuli!

771
00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:54.880
Liuli.

772
00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:56.440
Liuli.

773
00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:07.000
- My dear daughter.
- Father.

774
00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:08.520
Mother.

775
00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:10.230
Let me see you.

776
00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:12.000
I miss you so much.

777
00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:13.590
I miss you all, too.

778
00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:18.080
Where is big brother?

779
00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:19.520
Brother and his wife couldn't make it,

780
00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:20.560
but they asked me

781
00:37:20.590 --> 00:37:21.560
to bring you a gift.

782
00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:23.630
He just didn't want to come back

783
00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:24.750
after he got married.

784
00:37:25.110 --> 00:37:26.480
Don't be ridiculous.

785
00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:29.440
Mother, father, brother.

786
00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:30.590
Look.

787
00:37:30.670 --> 00:37:32.400
These are gifts from
the Empress Dowager, His Majesty

788
00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:34.080
and the Crown Prince.

789
00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:36.840
I am doing well in the capital.

790
00:37:38.110 --> 00:37:38.750
Come here.

791
00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:40.150
Let me see.

792
00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:42.960
Silly girl.

793
00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:44.520
You are alone here

794
00:37:44.590 --> 00:37:46.000
without anyone to look after you.

795
00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:46.960
See?

796
00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:49.840
She's losing weight.

797
00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:52.960
Enough.

798
00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:54.040
We can

799
00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:55.270
catch up at home.

800
00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:56.880
- Come on. Let's go home.
- Let's go.

801
00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:00.270
Greetings, General Hua,

802
00:38:00.310 --> 00:38:01.110
General Wei.

803
00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:03.040
Westerly Foot?

804
00:38:04.270 --> 00:38:05.880
Please rise.

805
00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:07.110
I've never forgotten

806
00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:09.230
your nickname.

807
00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:11.440
Westerly Foot.

808
00:38:15.580 --> 00:38:17.920
(Yanqi Gate)

809
00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:18.670
Father.

810
00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:20.840
Our family

811
00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:22.310
has made a great contribution,

812
00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:23.840
but His Majesty

813
00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:25.400
wouldn't even bother

814
00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:27.750
to come and welcome you.

815
00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:32.310
Liuli.

816
00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:36.150
His Majesty allowed
your mother and I

817
00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:38.480
to return to the capital
in a discreet way

818
00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:40.000
after I have written to him.

819
00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:42.270
It's already a chaotic situation.

820
00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:45.040
If we make a fuss,

821
00:38:45.230 --> 00:38:47.790
it'll be disadvantageous to our family.

822
00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:49.360
Yes.

823
00:38:51.590 --> 00:38:52.230
By the way,

824
00:38:52.590 --> 00:38:54.560
His Highness has arranged for me

825
00:38:54.590 --> 00:38:56.310
to live in our old house
in the western suburbs.

826
00:38:56.590 --> 00:38:57.960
It's a bit far away.

827
00:38:58.110 --> 00:38:59.400
Let's hurry home.

828
00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:01.110
Great! Let's go.

829
00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:02.440
Back to our old house.

830
00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:02.960
Let's go.

831
00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:04.360
- General, look.
- Let's go.

832
00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:08.750
It's the Crown Prince.

833
00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:11.790
Let's go.

834
00:39:25.310 --> 00:39:27.080
I, General Hua Yingting...

835
00:39:27.310 --> 00:39:28.230
Wei Mingyue.

836
00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:30.480
- Came to greet you, Your Highness.
- Came to greet you, Your Highness.

837
00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:37.960
Welcome back,

838
00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:39.670
the victorious Protector General.

839
00:39:40.190 --> 00:39:42.630
Welcome back,

840
00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:44.190
the victorious Protector General.

841
00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:47.560
Welcome back!

842
00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:49.230
Welcome back!

843
00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:51.110
Welcome back!

844
00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:54.790
Welcome back!

845
00:39:55.150 --> 00:39:58.440
Welcome back!

846
00:39:58.790 --> 00:40:02.080
Welcome back!

847
00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:09.340
Welcome back!

848
00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:15.560
Mother, look.

849
00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:18.560
- It's all here.
- Changkong, look there.

850
00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:21.190
This fan is still here.

851
00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:21.920
Let me take a good look.

852
00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:22.560
Is it nice?

853
00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:23.080
Yes.

854
00:40:23.310 --> 00:40:24.750
Here, mother.

855
00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:26.270
Father.

856
00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:27.360
Okay.

857
00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:28.080
Brother.

858
00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:29.360
Try it.

859
00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:30.670
Does it have a taste
of Qinghan Prefecture?

860
00:40:30.670 --> 00:40:31.190
Try it.

861
00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:35.520
Did you make this?

862
00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:36.270
Of course.

863
00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:37.520
My daughter is amazing.

864
00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:38.310
Right?

865
00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:39.710
As expected of Liuli.

866
00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:41.440
Father, mother, brother.

867
00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:42.520
Go to your rooms

868
00:40:42.590 --> 00:40:43.230
and get some rest.

869
00:40:43.230 --> 00:40:43.880
Later on,

870
00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:45.150
I'll show you around the street.

871
00:40:45.230 --> 00:40:46.040
It's interesting.

872
00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:47.080
Great.

873
00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:47.750
I can't wait for it.

874
00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:48.590
Wait.

875
00:40:48.750 --> 00:40:49.270
Okay.

876
00:40:50.110 --> 00:40:51.110
That can wait.

877
00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:54.710
Did you get into trouble again?

878
00:40:54.790 --> 00:40:56.670
Mother, I didn't.

879
00:40:56.710 --> 00:40:57.560
Really?

880
00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:00.150
Father, look at her.

881
00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:01.520
Honey.

882
00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:03.750
We just came back.
Let's not talk about this.

883
00:41:03.790 --> 00:41:04.840
Fan yourself.

884
00:41:05.590 --> 00:41:07.080
- Okay.
- General, madam.

885
00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:08.310
The meal is ready.

886
00:41:08.670 --> 00:41:09.400
Great.

887
00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:10.110
Honey, let's eat.

888
00:41:10.110 --> 00:41:10.880
Time to eat.

889
00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:11.590
- Let's eat.
- Okay.

890
00:41:11.590 --> 00:41:12.310
I'm starving.

891
00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.110
That's how

892
00:41:17.150 --> 00:41:19.270
I became the Ceremonial Officer.

893
00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:21.590
I have to go to court every day,

894
00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:23.270
which is very hard.

895
00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:25.480
You just became the Ceremonial Officer.

896
00:41:25.710 --> 00:41:28.230
Did you offend anyone in the process?

897
00:41:28.310 --> 00:41:29.440
Did you have a grudge against anyone?

898
00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:32.630
Do your father and I

899
00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:34.750
need to go to every door to apologise?

900
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:37.440
Mother.

901
00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:40.190
I'm not that much of a troublemaker.

902
00:41:40.310 --> 00:41:41.560
You are.

903
00:41:42.590 --> 00:41:43.560
Liuli.

904
00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:45.230
Whatever you've done,

905
00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:47.040
your mother and I can
take care of it for you.

906
00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:49.920
Yes.

907
00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:51.150
Let us know

908
00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:52.630
if you need me to settle

909
00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:53.560
any of your accounts.

910
00:41:55.110 --> 00:41:56.960
I'll take you to smash the doors

911
00:41:57.150 --> 00:41:58.630
of those civil officials tomorrow.

912
00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:00.400
Liuli.

913
00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:01.880
That won't do.

914
00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:03.670
We just returned to the capital.

915
00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:05.520
We need to keep a low profile.

916
00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:06.880
I know

917
00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:08.270
you feel

918
00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:09.190
a little upset,

919
00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:10.480
but there are still

920
00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:11.000
people who

921
00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:11.960
care about our family.

922
00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:13.270
His Highness, for example.

923
00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:14.790
He came all the way here.

924
00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:16.360
I haven't seen him for many years.

925
00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:17.630
His Highness

926
00:42:17.670 --> 00:42:19.310
is much more handsome.

927
00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:20.110
Honey.

928
00:42:21.110 --> 00:42:23.310
Is that what you should be focusing on?

929
00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:24.920
His Highness

930
00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:26.840
always says he is simple-looking.

931
00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:28.630
Have you ever seen such a humble person?

932
00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:31.190
Liuli, has this

933
00:42:31.270 --> 00:42:32.750
become your focus too?

934
00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:39.480
Liuli, let me ask you.

935
00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:41.790
Have you met

936
00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:42.630
a man you like

937
00:42:42.670 --> 00:42:44.080
during your stay here?

938
00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:45.310
Father.

939
00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:48.190
So what?

940
00:42:48.590 --> 00:42:50.150
She doesn't need a man.

941
00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:52.110
It's a blessing for that man

942
00:42:52.230 --> 00:42:54.400
if my little sister is attracted to him.

943
00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:55.590
Well said.

944
00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:57.840
No.

945
00:42:58.230 --> 00:43:00.230
I am a delicate lady

946
00:43:00.310 --> 00:43:01.840
in the capital.

947
00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:03.590
I am not fit for those things.

948
00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:08.960
Gentlemen.

949
00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:11.790
I heard that the Hua family

950
00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:14.150
has arrived in the capital today.

951
00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:15.710
Did you know that?

952
00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:17.150
I heard that His Highness

953
00:43:17.190 --> 00:43:19.560
even stopped in the city on purpose.

954
00:43:19.710 --> 00:43:21.670
The fact that the Hua family
has returned this time

955
00:43:21.710 --> 00:43:22.880
only shows that

956
00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:27.750
His Majesty has long been
cautious of the Hua family.

957
00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:29.440
In fact, even if Hua Liuli

958
00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:30.400
had become

959
00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:33.000
the Ceremonial Officer,

960
00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:35.000
so what?

961
00:43:36.670 --> 00:43:38.110
That makes sense.

962
00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:40.360
- That makes sense.
- That makes sense.

963
00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:45.060
(Grand Preceptor Mansion)

964
00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:52.310
Is everything done?

965
00:43:52.750 --> 00:43:54.360
I have wiped up all the blood

966
00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:55.520
on the outside with water,

967
00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:57.110
as you instructed me to do,

968
00:43:57.190 --> 00:43:58.710
but are you sure you want to

969
00:43:58.750 --> 00:44:00.440
keep such a dangerous man in the house?

970
00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:02.310
I'm sure.

971
00:44:03.790 --> 00:44:05.150
You've pawned

972
00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:06.230
almost all of your dowry

973
00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:07.960
for a ginseng.

974
00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:09.480
What if your father

975
00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:10.710
finds out?

976
00:44:11.310 --> 00:44:12.630
Saving a life is more important

977
00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.880
than not being scolded by my family.

978
00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:16.520
Have you forgotten

979
00:44:16.590 --> 00:44:17.590
Du's family rules?

980
00:44:17.590 --> 00:44:18.790
Still, Miss,

981
00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:20.710
what about your reputation?

982
00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:25.190
His life is at stake.

983
00:44:25.590 --> 00:44:27.590
We'll talk about it later.

984
00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:29.590
You go outside and keep a lookout.

985
00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:45.460
(Blacksmith Shop)

986
00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:06.400
Young Master Yun.

987
00:45:06.790 --> 00:45:08.270
Drink some ginseng soup.

988
00:45:16.670 --> 00:45:17.590
Lady Du.

989
00:45:20.310 --> 00:45:20.790
You...

990
00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:23.710
I am sorry.

991
00:45:24.750 --> 00:45:25.710
No problem.

992
00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:28.710
Young Master Yun.

993
00:45:29.270 --> 00:45:30.560
You are seriously injured.

994
00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:32.040
Take a few days

995
00:45:32.110 --> 00:45:33.920
to rest and recuperate.

996
00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:36.560
I made some ginseng soup for you.

997
00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:39.270
Drink while it's hot.

998
00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:48.920
Young Master Yun, let me help you.

999
00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:28.980
(Pretentious Hour)

1000
00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:31.460
(One person suffers.)

1001
00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:34.150
Is this ginkgo leaf butterfly

1002
00:46:34.310 --> 00:46:36.000
only going to work once

1003
00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:38.000
and never again?

1004
00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:40.440
Miss.

1005
00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:40.880
I think

1006
00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:42.480
you can only make it

1007
00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:43.750
in front of His Highness.

1008
00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:45.750
You can even make bunnies,

1009
00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:47.230
frogs and so on.

1010
00:46:47.270 --> 00:46:49.710
After all, it's about impressing a man.

1011
00:46:50.270 --> 00:46:51.040
As expected of a woman.

1012
00:46:52.750 --> 00:46:53.840
Like this?

1013
00:46:56.750 --> 00:46:58.440
