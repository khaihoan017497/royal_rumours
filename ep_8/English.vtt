17
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.560
Princess Hua is here!

18
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.000
Greetings, Your Majesty.

19
00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.040
Rise.

20
00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:59.230
Thank you, Your Majesty.

21
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.040
Princess Hua,

22
00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.400
do you know why

23
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.280
I summoned you?

24
00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.800
I don't know.

25
00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:12.360
I'm not sexist,

26
00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.310
but Princess Hua is frail

27
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.750
as she faints when the wind is strong.

28
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.310
How can she represent

29
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.560
the State of Jin to
negotiate with other states

30
00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.120
with her image?

31
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.430
(Wait.)

32
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.150
(Why am I involved?)

33
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.870
(Your Highness is terrible.)

34
00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.080
(I've pleased you)

35
00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.120
(for this matter)

36
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.400
(and you betrayed me.)

37
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.840
Your Majesty,

38
00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.560
no way I can do that.

39
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.470
Grand Preceptor Du is right.

40
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.710
I'm frail and sick.

41
00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.000
I can't handle the responsibility.

42
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:43.710
I might

43
00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.560
bring disgrace to Jin.

44
00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.870
Princess Hua,

45
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.150
back through time

46
00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.030
the women in Jin are independent.

47
00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.000
They can all

48
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:55.630
take full responsibility.

49
00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.240
You have the Hua family's honour,

50
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.000
so you must have
the Hua family's courage.

51
00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:01.910
I hope

52
00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.560
you'll finish the task

53
00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.000
regardless of the result.

54
00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.360
(I'm tasting my own medicine.)

55
00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.400
I understand.

56
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:14.470
Princess Hua.

57
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.960
You're strong. You can walk so fast.

58
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.910
You didn't keep your word.

59
00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.030
I'm not talking to you anymore.

60
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:24.710
(This is the reason why)

61
00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:26.310
(I brought you to the capital.)

62
00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:27.430
(Liuli,)

63
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.560
(don't blame me.)

64
00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:31.360
What?

65
00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.430
Isn't it His Highness?

66
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.910
Why has it become you?

67
00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:36.840
I think

68
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.190
I have the upper hand.

69
00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.840
You're preparing already?

70
00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.150
Think about it.

71
00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.680
Instead on counting our fate on others,

72
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.910
(Hua Liuli's strength)
and he's the Crown Prince

73
00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.520
(His Highness' shortcomings)
who has lost his reputation,

74
00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.310
why not I fight

75
00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.030
for it myself?

76
00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.520
You do have

77
00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:55.960
one biggest strength.

78
00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.120
What's it?

79
00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.150
Tell me.

80
00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.960
Let me write it down.

81
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.710
Amitabha.

82
00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.750
Learn to let go.

83
00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:12.630
Your Highness.

84
00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:14.000
Your Highness.

85
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.120
I'm here.

86
00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:16.360
Just in time.

87
00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:17.190
Come on.

88
00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:18.600
Play chess with me.

89
00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:19.950
Now, I know why

90
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.720
you like to stay

91
00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:21.830
in Ankang Garden.

92
00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:23.240
The palace

93
00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:24.560
is full of nonsense.

94
00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:26.160
Also...

95
00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.480
Also what?

96
00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:29.560
Also, Fafa is not around.

97
00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.480
We're changing the people

98
00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.830
in Ankang Garden.

99
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.950
I need to monitor them.

100
00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.480
Yes.

101
00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:35.160
I just wanted to

102
00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.950
tell you about this.

103
00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.680
After what happened yesterday,

104
00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.430
Commander Wei

105
00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.920
and everyone in the Supreme Court

106
00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:43.680
were questioned by His Majesty.

107
00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:45.430
We really need to upgrade

108
00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:46.870
the security in the capital.

109
00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.750
Yes.

110
00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.240
Help me

111
00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.600
monitor Hua Liuli closely.

112
00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:56.430
Yes.

113
00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.750
I'll monitor her maid closely.

114
00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.240
Why are you monitoring

115
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:04.120
her maid?

116
00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.750
Your Highness.

117
00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:08.270
If

118
00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:09.560
you want others to

119
00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:10.750
know what you do,

120
00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.160
get someone to monitor me and Yun Han.

121
00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.390
Isn't that the most effective way?

122
00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.750
Monitor Qi and Ba.

123
00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:19.120
What you said

124
00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.510
makes sense.

125
00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:21.070
Right?

126
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.160
So,

127
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:23.870
I'll monitor her closely.

128
00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:26.240
Monitor her closely.

129
00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:27.830
Monitor her closely.

130
00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.070
Monitor her closely.

131
00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:31.260
(Shoukang Palace)

132
00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:38.680
What are you all doing?

133
00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.680
Her Highness will punish you
if she sees this.

134
00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:42.120
The distance between the fabrics

135
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:43.040
(Duan Jin)
has to be balance.

136
00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.000
Her Highness is here!

137
00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:47.510
Handle this quickly.

138
00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.480
Yes.

139
00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:14.700
(The Empress Dowager of Jin)

140
00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:25.310
Greetings, grandmother.

141
00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:26.560
Rise.

142
00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.070
Thank you, grandmother.

143
00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.120
What?

144
00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:33.870
You don't usually come so early.

145
00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:35.510
Did

146
00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.830
the sun rise up from the west?

147
00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:40.510
Grandmother,

148
00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:42.000
I indeed have to meet you

149
00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:43.720
for a matter.

150
00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:46.800
It's regarding the Ceremonial Officer.

151
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.480
I think

152
00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.310
I'm the eldest prince.

153
00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.630
It's my responsibility to

154
00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.600
represent the State of Jin.

155
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.720
But obviously Hua Liuli

156
00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:58.310
didn't want to compete for it

157
00:06:58.830 --> 00:06:59.750
yet Yuansu

158
00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:01.480
recommended her strongly to father.

159
00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:02.920
Grandmother,

160
00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.800
you didn't see that Hua Liuli

161
00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:06.040
almost cried

162
00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:07.560
in the imperial court.

163
00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:09.920
I pity her.

164
00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:11.630
Really?

165
00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:14.070
It's true.

166
00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.920
I got it.

167
00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.680
Go back

168
00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.120
and prepare your things first.

169
00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.070
I'm leaving now.

170
00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:34.160
Such a honest child.

171
00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.800
If the girl doesn't want to compete,

172
00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:42.560
why would Yuansu recommend her?

173
00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:45.160
I'm summoned again?

174
00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.040
And it's Her Highness
who is summoning me?

175
00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.070
How would I know?

176
00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:51.000
Is Her Highness going to punish us?

177
00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:57.680
My eye is twitching faster now.

178
00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:00.780
(Ambitious)

179
00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.510
Greetings, Princess Hua.

180
00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:05.750
Please come with me

181
00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:07.390
to meet Her Highness in the palace.

182
00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:09.830
Please hold on.

183
00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:12.240
I have a question.

184
00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:14.160
There shall be no delay in
meeting Her Highness.

185
00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:17.120
Please come with me quickly.

186
00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:22.680
I'm frail.

187
00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.510
The entire capital

188
00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.190
knows about this.

189
00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.240
I might faint

190
00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:30.560
at any time.

191
00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:32.030
This is

192
00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:34.030
out of my control.

193
00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:35.120
Your Highness,

194
00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.240
are you threatening me?

195
00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:51.360
(Why haven't we arrived yet?)

196
00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:52.910
(It's tiring.)

197
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:00.720
Stop.

198
00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.390
Greetings, Duan Jin.

199
00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:07.120
Greetings, Your Highness.

200
00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:08.120
Your Highness.

201
00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:09.720
Well,

202
00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:11.480
why is Princess Hua entering
the palace again?

203
00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:12.720
Your Highness,

204
00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:15.030
Her Highness is summoning Princess Hua.

205
00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:16.670
Really?

206
00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:19.480
But Shoukang Palace is

207
00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:21.030
far away from here.

208
00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:23.120
Listen.

209
00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:25.000
Go with my sedan.

210
00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.550
What about Your Highness?

211
00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:30.320
I'm free.

212
00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:31.320
I can walk around.

213
00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:35.910
Your Highness is kind.

214
00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:37.320
I appreciate it.

215
00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:39.120
Although I'm frail,

216
00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.150
I can walk

217
00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:41.510
this distance.

218
00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:43.360
I'm not concerned about your body.

219
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:45.080
You're walking too slowly.

220
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:47.320
Don't let Her Highness wait.

221
00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:48.670
Come on.

222
00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:50.440
Go up.

223
00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:53.550
Hurry.

224
00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:54.390
Stop hesitating.

225
00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:55.720
Her Highness is waiting.

226
00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:19.500
(Shoukang Palace)

227
00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:30.320
I'm Hua Liuli.

228
00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:31.480
Greetings, Your Highness.

229
00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:33.390
May peace be upon you, Your Highness.

230
00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:51.440
I heard that

231
00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.550
you came here

232
00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:55.390
by Yuansu's sedan.

233
00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.000
His Highness is kind.

234
00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:01.360
He knows that I'm frail.

235
00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:03.670
I'm thankful

236
00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:06.030
to his kindness.

237
00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:09.480
Since you're not feeling well,

238
00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:13.080
just stay in Shoukang Palace.

239
00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:15.480
Stay here?

240
00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:17.080
What?

241
00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:20.750
You don't like

242
00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:21.960
my chamber?

243
00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:29.000
It's good.

244
00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.720
Staying by Your Highness' side

245
00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:33.750
is my honour.

246
00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:35.600
Duan Jin.

247
00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:38.120
Send a few people

248
00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.550
to tidy up the side chamber.

249
00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:42.840
Then invite the imperial physician here

250
00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:47.240
to check on Princess Hua.

251
00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.790
(She wants to ground me here.)

252
00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:51.150
Once she's recuperated,

253
00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:53.030
I've done

254
00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:55.320
a big favour to

255
00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:57.270
Protector General's family

256
00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:00.000
as a good deed.

257
00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:01.670
Yes.

258
00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:03.440
Go back first.

259
00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:05.000
Take a good rest.

260
00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:07.960
Thank you, Your Highness.

261
00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:32.550
Miss,

262
00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:33.840
which one of your eyes

263
00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:35.030
is twitching again?

264
00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:37.000
Yuan Wei,

265
00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:39.320
go back and keep my stuff.

266
00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:41.000
Bring over the things that

267
00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.270
we don't have here.

268
00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:45.510
No need.

269
00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:49.440
Miss Yuan Wei,

270
00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:50.670
where are you going?

271
00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:52.550
Madam Duan Jin.

272
00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:55.670
I'm going home

273
00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:56.320
to bring some of

274
00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:57.510
Miss Hua's things here.

275
00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:59.480
Since Her Highness asked you
to stay here,

276
00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:01.600
of course we've prepared everything.

277
00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:09.080
(It seems like they've been
preparing for this.)

278
00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:11.790
I'm leaving now.

279
00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:14.790
Thank you, Madam Duan Jin.

280
00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:19.150
Gentlemen,

281
00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:21.150
have you heard about

282
00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:22.480
Her Highness...

283
00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:28.390
Her Highness has grounded Hua Liuli

284
00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:30.080
in the palace.

285
00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:32.720
His Majesty has just decided

286
00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:34.030
to let Hua Liuli and Prince Ying

287
00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:35.150
compete for the position.

288
00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:38.000
Her Highness has immediately
grounded Princess Hua

289
00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:39.120
in the palace and

290
00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:40.030
doesn't allow her to go out.

291
00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:41.240
It's obvious that

292
00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:42.480
Her Highness doesn't want

293
00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:44.200
Hua Liuli to be selected.

294
00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:47.720
Hua Liuli has been grounded
in the palace.

295
00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:49.510
This is a good opportunity

296
00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:50.720
for Prince Ying.

297
00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:52.670
We must plan well to

298
00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:53.910
seize the opportunity

299
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:55.030
so that His Highness

300
00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:56.630
will defeat Hua Liuli.

301
00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:59.200
What do you think?

302
00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:00.510
Good idea.

303
00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:01.630
It makes sense.

304
00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:02.440
Great.

305
00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:03.670
Here.

306
00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:18.910
Mother, did you ask me to come

307
00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:20.630
just to play chess with you?

308
00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:26.200
I want Hua Liuli

309
00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:28.360
to stay in the palace for a while.

310
00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:30.750
I'll monitor her for you all.

311
00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:33.670
Yuanhao and Yuansu

312
00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:35.240
have never been through

313
00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:36.840
any trouble.

314
00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:38.750
How will they know

315
00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:40.550
how to judge a girl

316
00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:42.440
who grew up

317
00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:44.120
at the border?

318
00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:48.630
You're right.

319
00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:49.440
Here.

320
00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:57.600
Fafa,

321
00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:58.720
say hi to Hanhan.

322
00:14:58.790 --> 00:14:59.120
Here.

323
00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.670
It comes to you yet you reject it.

324
00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:03.600
Let me tell you.

325
00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:04.320
One day,

326
00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:05.030
you'll yield to

327
00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:06.150
Fafa's beauty.

328
00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:07.870
Here's its gift.

329
00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:09.750
Fafa, look.

330
00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:10.480
Do you like it?

331
00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:11.510
No.

332
00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:11.790
Thank you.

333
00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:12.790
Take it away.

334
00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:15.550
Jihuai.

335
00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:16.790
Stop it.

336
00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:20.360
Fafa, is it nice?

337
00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:22.000
Let's be serious now.

338
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:25.030
Princess Hua has been grounded
by grandmother

339
00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:26.030
in the palace.

340
00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:28.510
I'm afraid
the Ceremonial Officer position

341
00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:30.550
will be given to someone else.

342
00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:32.840
Your Highness, you're panicking
so you're confused.

343
00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:34.550
If Princess Hua doesn't want

344
00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:36.080
the position to be taken,

345
00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:38.120
she'll think of a way.

346
00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:40.720
Looking at how smart she is,

347
00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:42.440
we can expect her to do something.

348
00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:46.630
It means

349
00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:49.030
she greets me every morning

350
00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:52.000
and goes back to the side chamber

351
00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.720
to wait quietly.

352
00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:57.030
Hasn't she mentioned going back?

353
00:15:57.550 --> 00:15:59.270
No.

354
00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:01.630
She just does the gardening

355
00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:03.000
in the side chamber.

356
00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:04.390
She's getting along

357
00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:05.510
with the maids

358
00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:07.030
in Shoukang Palace.

359
00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:12.750
How is she mingling with them?

360
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:15.360
The story today

361
00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:17.270
is about a chiliarch.

362
00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:18.390
After the breakout,

363
00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:19.510
he lost contact

364
00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:20.390
with the army.

365
00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:22.440
He almost died out of thirst
in the desert.

366
00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:23.910
Almost died?

367
00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:25.960
After wandering for a few days

368
00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:27.120
and when he was going to die

369
00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:27.910
out of thirst,

370
00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:28.670
he suddenly

371
00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:30.960
found oasis in the sky.

372
00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:32.720
She's telling them

373
00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:33.750
some stories about the border.

374
00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:34.960
The maids

375
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:36.240
have never heard of those.

376
00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:38.030
They think it's new.

377
00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:41.000
No wonder.

378
00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:42.840
Lately,

379
00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:44.550
I keep feeling

380
00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:47.150
like

381
00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:48.790
a few of them are missing

382
00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:51.120
except you.

383
00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:52.320
So

384
00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:54.480
she's brought them away.

385
00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:56.240
No way.

386
00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:57.320
Didn't His Highness

387
00:16:57.390 --> 00:16:58.750
come to greet you?

388
00:16:59.120 --> 00:16:59.840
(Shouning Hall)
It's because

389
00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:01.080
of the indication of
the water in the sky

390
00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:02.670
that he survives

391
00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:03.870
until he was saved.

392
00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:04.920
Also, he...

393
00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:06.720
Greetings, Your Highness,

394
00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:10.350
Your Highness,

395
00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:12.440
Go back.

396
00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:13.590
Yes.

397
00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:16.200
Princess Hua, it seems like

398
00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:18.200
you're doing well

399
00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:19.400
in my grandmother's palace.

400
00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:20.640
Yes.

401
00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:22.200
I can't go out.

402
00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:23.880
I can only walk around
in Shoukang Palace.

403
00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:25.480
Living a grounded life

404
00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:26.720
makes me healthier.

405
00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:28.480
Thank you for your concern,
Your Highness.

406
00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:30.310
Princess Hua,
are you still upset with me?

407
00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:31.590
I dare not

408
00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:33.000
be angry with Your Highness.

409
00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:36.960
I know that

410
00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:38.270
for you to participate the competition

411
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.110
is exactly what you want.

412
00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:41.440
If you're selected,

413
00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:42.920
that'd be great.

414
00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:44.240
Your Highness,

415
00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:46.030
it's easier said than done.

416
00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:47.590
Now,

417
00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:48.680
I can't even go out

418
00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:49.720
from Shoukang Palace.

419
00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:51.720
How can I be the Ceremonial Officer?

420
00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:55.200
Princess Hua, are you seeking my help?

421
00:17:58.640 --> 00:17:59.720
Your Highness,

422
00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:01.440
can you help me to get out of here?

423
00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:02.240
No.

424
00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:05.440
If I help you too much,

425
00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:07.720
grandmother will suspect us.

426
00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:09.510
To please her,

427
00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:10.310
I've even sent her

428
00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:12.000
some colourful fabrics,

429
00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:13.160
so...

430
00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:14.750
(Fabrics?)

431
00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:19.720
I'm tired.

432
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:20.640
Let's go back and rest.

433
00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:21.200
Okay.

434
00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:21.590
Hold on.

435
00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:22.960
Princess Hua.

436
00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:25.240
I want to know

437
00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:27.000
what happened to the chiliarch next.

438
00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:29.160
After the chiliarch

439
00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:30.400
was saved,

440
00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:32.440
he drew whatever he saw that day.

441
00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:33.960
It's the lake that

442
00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:35.590
I've mentioned to Your Highness before.

443
00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:37.880
It's called Holy Lake
in Qinghan Prefecture.

444
00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:39.550
That lake means

445
00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:41.000
a lot to us.

446
00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:42.160
We can't lose it.

447
00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:45.030
Greetings, Your Highness.

448
00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:46.310
Greetings, Princess Hua.

449
00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:48.000
Madam Duan Jin.

450
00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:50.070
I wonder

451
00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:51.880
if I should say this.

452
00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.400
Madam Duan Jin, don't mind that.

453
00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:55.510
Go ahead.

454
00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:00.030
Your Highness

455
00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:01.270
shouldn't come look for

456
00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:02.960
Princess Hua too often.

457
00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:08.750
I got it.

458
00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:13.720
I'm going back to take a rest.

459
00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:20.830
(That's all I can do for her.)

460
00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:23.480
(Grandmother is stubborn.)

461
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.160
(I want to see how you deal with her.)

462
00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:38.270
Peeling walnuts teaches you manners.

463
00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:39.310
Her Highness said

464
00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:41.640
while Your Highness is recuperating,

465
00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:42.750
you should do something

466
00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:44.350
to improve your manners.

467
00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:46.750
It happens that Prince Ying

468
00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:48.680
has given us a basket of walnuts.

469
00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:50.350
Her Highness asked me

470
00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:51.310
to send them over to you.

471
00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:53.510
Your Highness, please peel them all.

472
00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:56.350
It's killing two birds with a stone.

473
00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.160
I got it.

474
00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:20.400
Miss,

475
00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:21.110
when is Her Highness

476
00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:22.270
going to release us?

477
00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:23.590
Is Her Highness trying to
make our lives hard?

478
00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:30.640
Miss.

479
00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:32.310
You're...

480
00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:33.400
Why do the women in the harem

481
00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:34.960
like to peel walnuts?

482
00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:37.110
It's for

483
00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:37.830
our kidneys,

484
00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:38.400
brains,

485
00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:39.400
and wisdom.

486
00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:40.550
Then Prince Ying

487
00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:41.790
should keep it for himself.

488
00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:43.680
Why did he give it to Her Highness?

489
00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:45.400
It makes sense.

490
00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:47.920
Miss, open one more.

491
00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:55.440
Miss, it's 3 a.m. now.

492
00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:56.110
It's time to get up.

493
00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:57.680
You're awake.

494
00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:03.200
Miss,

495
00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:04.310
you've been telling

496
00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:05.510
(Get the fabrics before 1 p.m.)
so many stories

497
00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:06.640
for this.

498
00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:09.070
It's the reminder given by His Highness.

499
00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:10.880
He gave you a reminder?

500
00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:11.790
All right.

501
00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:13.270
Help your

502
00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:14.590
frail Princess Hua

503
00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:16.240
to greet Her Highness.

504
00:21:16.790 --> 00:21:17.350
Okay.

505
00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:32.720
Your Highness.

506
00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:34.030
She hasn't left?

507
00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:35.000
She hasn't.

508
00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:36.830
Get her to come in.

509
00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:37.960
Yes.

510
00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:40.960
Duan Jin.

511
00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:42.920
Jingzhe is over.

512
00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:44.590
We need to

513
00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:47.400
make some light and soft dresses.

514
00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:48.400
Cuilan.

515
00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:51.270
Your Highness, please take a look

516
00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:52.350
if these fabrics

517
00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:53.510
are suitable.

518
00:21:58.590 --> 00:22:00.640
Your Highness, Princess Hua is here.

519
00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:06.030
Greetings, Your Highness.

520
00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:12.400
Your Highness,
are you choosing the fabrics

521
00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:14.110
to make dresses for spring?

522
00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:19.920
If it's for spring,

523
00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:21.720
I think...

524
00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:23.310
I think

525
00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:24.720
this is not bad.

526
00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:25.680
Why do you say so?

527
00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:28.880
Spring reminds us of

528
00:22:29.030 --> 00:22:30.960
"Casually acquainted with
the face of the east wind.

529
00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:33.200
A myriad of colours
always bring the spring."

530
00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:35.960
However, purple and red

531
00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:38.200
are too bright.

532
00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:41.030
Actually, my favourite colour

533
00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:42.350
is the green colour that Your Highness

534
00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:43.350
is holding.

535
00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:44.550
It's just that

536
00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:46.550
it looks ordinary.

537
00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:48.960
So I think

538
00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:50.480
this purple colour

539
00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:52.000
gives us the feeling of

540
00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:53.750
bloomy spring.

541
00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:55.400
It makes us happy.

542
00:22:57.880 --> 00:22:59.200
However...

543
00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:01.000
What's not right?

544
00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.000
I...

545
00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:08.240
I think

546
00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:09.830
I've come out for too long.

547
00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:11.790
I've caught a cold.

548
00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:14.000
I don't want to infect Your Highness.

549
00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:16.030
I'm leaving now.

550
00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:18.640
I'll come and greet
Your Highness tomorrow.

551
00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:24.200
She has left?

552
00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:26.240
Look at her.

553
00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:29.240
Greetings, Your Highness.

554
00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:33.830
Find the accessories for the purple

555
00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:35.880
that you chose yesterday.

556
00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:39.000
Yes.

557
00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:56.310
Your Highness.

558
00:23:56.790 --> 00:23:59.200
I think that purple

559
00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:00.720
is a gentle colour.

560
00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:02.720
We can choose some pearls

561
00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:03.510
as accessories.

562
00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:05.160
We can also choose the same fabric

563
00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:06.830
to make floral ornament

564
00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.480
to match with the dress.

565
00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:10.680
Also...

566
00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:16.680
I think

567
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.920
I've caught a cold

568
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:19.960
again.

569
00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:22.960
Go back quickly.

570
00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:41.510
Your Highness, Princess Hua is here.

571
00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:43.440
You're here just in time.

572
00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:46.550
Finish what you wanted to say

573
00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:47.880
yesterday.

574
00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.550
I think

575
00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:56.880
using gold colour

576
00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:58.480
is too old-fashioned.

577
00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:00.830
And the green colour

578
00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:03.110
doesn't match with the fabric.

579
00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:07.000
This is too exaggerated.

580
00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:08.070
This

581
00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:10.030
is not refined or sophisticated.

582
00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:10.880
This...

583
00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:11.400
Enough.

584
00:25:12.550 --> 00:25:13.550
You're rude.

585
00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:20.030
Your Highness, I'm sorry,

586
00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:22.070
but

587
00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:23.680
that's what I think.

588
00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:26.110
Dresses should be nice,

589
00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:28.070
comfortable and practical.

590
00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:31.550
If dresses are meant to be neat,

591
00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:33.160
why would there be,

592
00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:34.640
"By nature I have talent,
so it must have its use.

593
00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:36.550
Spent a thousand ounces of gold,
it will come back to me."

594
00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:38.830
It must have been written

595
00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:40.200
when the poet was drunk.

596
00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:42.350
And why would there be

597
00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:44.160
"The rosy clouds and the solitary
wild geese fly together,

598
00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:46.790
the autumn waters blend with
the vast sky in one colour."

599
00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.790
It must be the result

600
00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:50.830
after a long wait.

601
00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:53.440
If we live rigidly

602
00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:54.550
and go by the rules,

603
00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:56.480
how will we hear and write

604
00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:57.920
all these?

605
00:25:58.550 --> 00:26:00.110
What do you know?

606
00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:01.640
Go back!

607
00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:03.310
Yes.

608
00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:09.070
Can I be bold

609
00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:10.640
and ask

610
00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:12.880
for the fabric

611
00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:14.110
to be given to me?

612
00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:15.270
Take it away.

613
00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:18.640
Take that away too.

614
00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:23.920
Thank you, Your Highness.

615
00:26:32.790 --> 00:26:33.830
I'll give all these

616
00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:35.590
you all.

617
00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:36.960
Go back.

618
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.480
Thank you, Your Highness.

619
00:26:45.550 --> 00:26:47.000
(She's rude with words)

620
00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:48.880
(and she's domineering.)

621
00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:53.000
(Indeed a girl from the border.)

622
00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:57.070
(How dare you talk to me like that.)

623
00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:03.480
(I'll teach you)

624
00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:05.350
(a lesson.)

625
00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:24.270
Miss, I've found out.

626
00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:25.240
I've found out.

627
00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:27.750
Miss, what are you doing?

628
00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:30.110
I'm practising.

629
00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:31.480
Miss,

630
00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:33.200
can you be serious?

631
00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:35.000
Am I not serious enough?

632
00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:36.240
I'm doing this

633
00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:37.960
to fulfil my dream.

634
00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:40.110
What did you find out?

635
00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:41.880
Her Highness almost died

636
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.790
because of the consort.

637
00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:45.310
She has been sick since then.

638
00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:46.350
She follows rules and
keeps within bounds.

639
00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:48.200
Even the arrangement of the fabrics

640
00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:49.400
has its special requirement.

641
00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:50.030
Oh yes.

642
00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:51.720
The fabrics that's given to us
by Her Highness.

643
00:27:51.790 --> 00:27:52.350
First of all,

644
00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:53.790
she has never made
any dresses for anyone.

645
00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:54.640
Secondly,

646
00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:56.200
even those outside of Shoukang Palace

647
00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:57.510
have never seen it.

648
00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:18.960
Father! Mother!

649
00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:20.310
Father!

650
00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:30.160
(Qinghan Prefecture)
Father!

651
00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:33.830
Mother!

652
00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:39.400
Father! Mother!

653
00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:00.110
Father! Mother!

654
00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:03.440
I'll never let the Hua family suffer.

655
00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:05.960
I'll never let others

656
00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:07.640
control our fate

657
00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:09.240
at their will.

658
00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:12.590
I wonder how father and mother

659
00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:15.000
are doing now.

660
00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:30.590
Consort Lin,

661
00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:32.110
you rarely come out.

662
00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:34.350
Looking at your face,

663
00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:35.110
you should come out

664
00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:36.310
for the sun more often.

665
00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:38.640
I was sick a few days back.

666
00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:40.270
I would be glad

667
00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:41.350
if I'm as healthy

668
00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:43.270
as you two.

669
00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:45.680
Consort Xian,

670
00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:47.880
(Consort Shu)
it's time for us to chat.

671
00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:48.920
Yes.

672
00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:50.830
It's time for us to chat.

673
00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:56.510
Go and take a walk.

674
00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:58.550
I'll talk to the consorts.

675
00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:00.030
(Prince Ji Yuanhong)
I'll look for you later.

676
00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:17.070
The hairpin flower on your head

677
00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:18.110
is beautiful.

678
00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:20.480
It's more beautiful than

679
00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:21.640
the pear blossom in the garden.

680
00:30:22.270 --> 00:30:23.680
His Majesty gave it to me lately.

681
00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:24.550
These are

682
00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:26.310
Consort Xian and Consort Shu.

683
00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:31.590
Greetings, Your Highness.

684
00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:34.510
You're good at drawing.

685
00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:36.350
It's simple and clear.

686
00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:37.310
This is the highest level

687
00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:38.400
in drawing.

688
00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:41.640
(I heard that Prince Yuanhong
is a man of few words.)

689
00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:43.240
(He's always drawing something.)

690
00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:44.880
(Now that I've met him today...)

691
00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:46.720
This is Prince Ying.

692
00:31:00.590 --> 00:31:02.720
(He's actually a nice guy.)

693
00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:05.110
This is Crown Prince.

694
00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:09.590
Your Highness,

695
00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:11.440
can you

696
00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:12.960
draw me?

697
00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:25.640
Your Highness.

698
00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:27.350
Go ahead.

699
00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:28.720
The consorts are

700
00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:30.240
viewing flowers at the back garden.

701
00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:31.640
Princess Hua is there too.

702
00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:36.240
It's fine.

703
00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:38.720
I can't lock her

704
00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:40.240
here.

705
00:31:59.750 --> 00:32:00.110
Look.

706
00:32:00.510 --> 00:32:01.590
It's cute.

707
00:32:01.790 --> 00:32:02.790
It's nice.

708
00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:05.920
Your Highness,

709
00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:07.200
let me ask you straight.

710
00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:08.240
Can you

711
00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:10.270
give this drawing to me?

712
00:32:12.550 --> 00:32:13.960
Thank you, Your Highness.

713
00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:15.680
Can you

714
00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:16.790
sign here?

715
00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.240
Just write your name will do.

716
00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:19.790
I can tell the rest that

717
00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:21.480
this is drawn by Your Highness.

718
00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:22.160
This will

719
00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:23.590
become your exclusive symbol.

720
00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:47.510
What are they talking about?

721
00:32:47.790 --> 00:32:48.640
Your Highness,

722
00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:50.640
Consort Xian was asking about

723
00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:52.240
where Princess Hua

724
00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:53.590
got her dress.

725
00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:56.830
What dress is she wearing?

726
00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:58.550
A purple dress.

727
00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:00.480
Princess Hua said

728
00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:02.550
the fabric was given by Your Highness.

729
00:33:02.830 --> 00:33:04.000
They don't believe

730
00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:06.480
because Your Highness
has grounded Princess Hua

731
00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:08.110
to avenge

732
00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:09.070
Prince Ying.

733
00:33:09.510 --> 00:33:11.240
They think Princess Hua

734
00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:12.510
was lying.

735
00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:14.270
Go on.

736
00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:16.960
Consort Xian has asked the tailor

737
00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:18.240
to make new dresses.

738
00:33:18.790 --> 00:33:20.550
Her Highness has even gone
to the Ministry of Revenue

739
00:33:20.790 --> 00:33:22.270
to ask for purple fabrics.

740
00:33:22.510 --> 00:33:23.750
Consort Shu

741
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.160
has asked the maids
to collect a lot of flowers

742
00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:28.070
to make a floral dress.

743
00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:30.110
Consort Lin has been complimenting

744
00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:32.310
the dress that Princess Hua's wearing.

745
00:33:33.550 --> 00:33:34.880
I think

746
00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:36.830
Hua Liuli

747
00:33:37.030 --> 00:33:39.310
is showing off on purpose.

748
00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:41.070
Your Highness is right.

749
00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:46.480
Your Highness,

750
00:33:46.510 --> 00:33:48.110
Princess Hua is seeking audience.

751
00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:01.830
Greetings, Your Highness.

752
00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:03.590
You're frail.

753
00:34:03.790 --> 00:34:04.830
Rise.

754
00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:06.680
Thank you, Your Highness.

755
00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:11.510
Your Highness,

756
00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:12.710
I went

757
00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:14.840
to view the back garden.

758
00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:15.920
The flowers in spring

759
00:34:16.110 --> 00:34:17.480
are blossoming beautifully.

760
00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:19.670
However...

761
00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:21.510
However?

762
00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:23.840
Why is there always a twist?

763
00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:26.030
Don't twist and turn

764
00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:28.400
when you're talking to me.

765
00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:31.550
However, all the people have seen

766
00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:33.280
the dress that's made of the fabric

767
00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:34.070
Your Highness has given

768
00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:35.440
said that it's nice.

769
00:34:35.670 --> 00:34:36.320
It's more

770
00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:38.280
beautiful than the flowers.

771
00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:39.590
This dress

772
00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:41.230
is really nice.

773
00:34:41.550 --> 00:34:44.030
You chose it yourself.

774
00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:47.280
That's because

775
00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:49.550
the fabric that Your Highness
has given to me is nice.

776
00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:51.550
Your Highness might not know

777
00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:53.480
they kept looking at me

778
00:34:53.630 --> 00:34:54.710
like they wanted to

779
00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:55.960
take my dress away.

780
00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:01.590
Did I say something wrong?

781
00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:04.190
I don't mean to

782
00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:06.070
tease the consorts.

783
00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:10.280
You're such a daring girl.

784
00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:14.280
Since Your Highness has given me

785
00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:15.550
nice fabric,

786
00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:17.670
I also have a gift

787
00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:19.030
for Your Highness.

788
00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:22.230
Yuan Wei.

789
00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:43.760
A few rags are sewn together

790
00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:45.590
and the pattern is messy.

791
00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:46.480
How could you ask me

792
00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:47.960
to wear this?

793
00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:49.280
This...

794
00:35:49.590 --> 00:35:51.440
This is ridiculous.

795
00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:52.480
Take it away.

796
00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:53.550
Take it away!

797
00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:57.000
I don't mean to offend Your Highness.

798
00:35:57.070 --> 00:35:58.480
Your Highness, please forgive me.

799
00:35:58.710 --> 00:36:01.000
When I was in Qinghan Prefecture,

800
00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:03.590
although the commoners
were living a tough life,

801
00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:05.760
we had our happy time.

802
00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:09.190
When it's quiet at night,

803
00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:11.230
everyone will be gathering
around the bonfire.

804
00:36:11.590 --> 00:36:13.000
We'd sing

805
00:36:13.150 --> 00:36:14.190
and dance.

806
00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:17.030
Their best dress

807
00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:18.440
is only a piece of rag

808
00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:19.550
to Your Highness.

809
00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:22.280
That's why I

810
00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:23.510
took Your Highness's

811
00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:24.510
rags

812
00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:26.280
to sew this dress.

813
00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:27.760
Actually,

814
00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.760
I wanted to tell Your Highness

815
00:36:30.070 --> 00:36:31.230
that you're already

816
00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:32.480
the best Empress Dowager in Jin

817
00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:33.800
to all of us.

818
00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:36.480
Now, the world is peaceful.

819
00:36:36.590 --> 00:36:38.400
You don't have to work so hard anymore.

820
00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:58.440
Your workmanship

821
00:36:58.590 --> 00:36:59.760
is indeed

822
00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:02.800
not too good.

823
00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:06.710
Your Highness, don't tease me.

824
00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:09.190
I'm not good at this.

825
00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:11.030
I was thinking.

826
00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:12.840
If Your Highness has time,

827
00:37:13.070 --> 00:37:14.480
please teach me.

828
00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:15.670
No way.

829
00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:19.670
If you've learned it well,

830
00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:21.440
then I

831
00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:23.400
will be behind you.

832
00:37:26.070 --> 00:37:26.840
Get up.

833
00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:30.960
Keep this for me.

834
00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:40.740
(Shoukang Palace)

835
00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:53.480
Prince Yuanhong is drawing here.

836
00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:55.880
Why is Your Highness standing here?

837
00:37:57.110 --> 00:37:58.480
I'm here to see you, Princess Hua.

838
00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:00.190
Who knows

839
00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:01.480
if you'd

840
00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:02.400
harm Yuanhong?

841
00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:03.800
I've tried

842
00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:06.110
your laxatives.

843
00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:11.150
(Shoukang Palace)
Your Highness, look.

844
00:38:13.110 --> 00:38:14.150
Are you

845
00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:15.480
two

846
00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:16.630
not on good term?

847
00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:18.150
- No way.
- No way.

848
00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:24.480
Shoukang Palace

849
00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:25.440
hasn't been so lively

850
00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:26.510
for a long time.

851
00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:28.190
Yes.

852
00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:30.800
When I was young,

853
00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:34.110
I liked to talk to

854
00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:35.670
different people

855
00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:38.000
in the back garden.

856
00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:40.880
But after a long time,

857
00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:44.000
I don't do that anymore.

858
00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:46.110
A lot of people

859
00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:48.000
may look kind on the surface,

860
00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:51.150
but they're bad on the inside.

861
00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:54.510
I've met so many people,

862
00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:59.360
so I know it's hard
to tell one's true colour

863
00:38:59.630 --> 00:39:02.920
from one's appearance.

864
00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:05.320
Your Highness, do you mean

865
00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:07.710
you've mistaken about Princess Hua?

866
00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:08.880
No.

867
00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:11.960
Being silly

868
00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.400
is not necessarily a good thing.

869
00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:16.760
Being schemeful and tactful

870
00:39:17.070 --> 00:39:18.920
is not necessarily a bad thing.

871
00:39:19.150 --> 00:39:21.920
It depends on how you use it.

872
00:39:23.070 --> 00:39:24.150
Before this,

873
00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:27.590
His Majesty wanted to marry Hua Liuli

874
00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:29.440
to Prince Ying.

875
00:39:29.590 --> 00:39:32.190
I thought it's not suitable.

876
00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:34.230
Looking at it now,

877
00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:35.800
she's smart

878
00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:37.480
and he's honest.

879
00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:40.550
They complement each other.

880
00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:42.760
Maybe

881
00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:46.030
they're a match in heaven.

882
00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:47.280
What about

883
00:39:48.110 --> 00:39:49.510
Crown Prince?

884
00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:52.320
He and Hua Liuli

885
00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:54.440
are troublemakers.

886
00:39:55.590 --> 00:39:57.590
If they're together,

887
00:39:57.670 --> 00:39:58.880
maybe

888
00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:01.670
they'll create a ruckus.

889
00:40:02.190 --> 00:40:02.880
Yes.

890
00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:07.920
Princess Hua, look.

891
00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:09.630
The flowers in Shoukang Palace
are blossoming.

892
00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:12.760
It's said people are more
beautiful than flowers.

893
00:40:13.590 --> 00:40:14.710
Your Highness,

894
00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.000
do you think

895
00:40:16.070 --> 00:40:17.400
the flowers are more beautiful

896
00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:18.800
or I'm more beautiful?

897
00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:21.150
Since your name

898
00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:22.800
is Hua Liuli,

899
00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:25.400
of course you're more beautiful.

900
00:40:30.510 --> 00:40:31.360
Your Highness.

901
00:40:31.590 --> 00:40:32.440
- Grandmother.
- Grandmother.

902
00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:35.960
Princess Hua.

903
00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:38.030
I want to ask you.

904
00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:41.360
What do you think about Yuanhao?

905
00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:44.480
I know

906
00:40:44.670 --> 00:40:47.070
you and him are competing
for the Ceremonial Officer position.

907
00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:48.510
(Why is Her Highness...)

908
00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:50.320
(Talking about Yuanhao?)

909
00:40:51.510 --> 00:40:53.030
Everyone knows

910
00:40:53.070 --> 00:40:56.150
he's honest.

911
00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:57.630
- (Actually, he's stupid.)
- (Actually, he's stupid.)

912
00:40:57.630 --> 00:40:58.920
I think

913
00:40:59.110 --> 00:41:01.510
when he gets married one day,

914
00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:03.880
he'll surely

915
00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:07.360
treasure his wife.

916
00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:20.940
(Pretentious hour)

917
00:41:22.110 --> 00:41:23.800
What are you drawing?

918
00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:25.230
(Vinegar)
A wolf.

919
00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:27.150
A jar of vinegar.

920
00:41:28.110 --> 00:41:29.960
The wolf is wearing clothes.

921
00:41:41.710 --> 00:41:42.510
Yuanhong.

922
00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.480
