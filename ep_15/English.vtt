17
00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.120
Where did you lose him?

18
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.920
We chased him all
the way to Jinque Street

19
00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.250
and he disappeared.

20
00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.480
Jinque Street

21
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.890
is a gathering place for dignitaries.

22
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.530
He is quite smart.

23
00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.530
He knew we wouldn't dare go near there.

24
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.840
This man won't cooperate with us.

25
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.330
I wonder if it is his own will

26
00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.850
or the will of his master behind him.

27
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.760
Looks like I need to change my way.

28
00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.200
Make the arrangements.

29
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.570
I want to see the general.

30
00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.480
Yes.

31
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.260
(Supreme Court)

32
00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.610
You only have an incense stick of time.

33
00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:37.450
Make haste.

34
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.730
Your Highness.

35
00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:47.480
General.

36
00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.480
I miss you.

37
00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.200
You must have suffered.

38
00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.570
Your Highness.

39
00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.330
I'm not even afraid to jump

40
00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.410
into the fire for you.

41
00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.760
General.

42
00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:59.640
Your Highness.

43
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.570
Are you here to rescue me?

44
00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.480
No.

45
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:08.450
I still need you

46
00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:09.890
to stay in jail longer.

47
00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:11.410
Then why are you lurking in the capital?

48
00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.130
Did you get rid of Hua Liuli?

49
00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.680
No.

50
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.130
Then...

51
00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:19.850
I know

52
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.610
You have found a partner.

53
00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.920
Well,

54
00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.850
that's not it.

55
00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.050
No?

56
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.480
You...

57
00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:30.200
However,

58
00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:31.680
I've found another way.

59
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.450
What is it?

60
00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.540
(Hua)

61
00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:43.130
This...

62
00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:44.520
What is this?

63
00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.240
You've been here for so long

64
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:47.050
and you still can't read?

65
00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.480
Brother, I've been here for so long,

66
00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.330
it's good enough that

67
00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.410
I can make myself clear.

68
00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.920
Hua Liuli.

69
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:53.960
Liu?

70
00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.640
Hua.

71
00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.170
I'd like to gamble on

72
00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.360
Hua Liuli's feelings for me.

73
00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.050
So you want to play with emotions.

74
00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.330
I can't believe you dare to do that.

75
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:08.920
That day I wore a mask

76
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.850
and she recognised me

77
00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:12.570
right away.

78
00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:13.480
I know.

79
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:14.610
The mask

80
00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.610
is marked with the symbol of Jinpo.

81
00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.290
That's not the point.

82
00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:21.970
She must have

83
00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:23.050
felt guilty about me.

84
00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:24.730
That's why she didn't

85
00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.730
disclose my presence in the capital.

86
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:27.650
I know.

87
00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.560
Lady Hua is up to something else.

88
00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.320
General A'Wa,

89
00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:34.050
you don't get it.

90
00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.120
Her feelings for me

91
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.530
are hidden in her eyes.

92
00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.050
In her eyes?

93
00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:46.290
General.

94
00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.240
I will not let you down.

95
00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.850
Let's go.

96
00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.120
Look, Your Highness.

97
00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:21.730
I knew I hadn't spent

98
00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:22.850
all this time in prison for nothing.

99
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.440
He really is in the capital.

100
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.880
He Yuanting's assassination failed.

101
00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:30.000
So he had to come up with a new plan.

102
00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.170
If we want to deal with him,

103
00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:35.680
we have to keep our eyes

104
00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:36.800
on Princess Hua.

105
00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:41.360
Your Highness, are you trying to

106
00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:42.770
keep a closer eye on Hua Liuli?

107
00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:44.530
I just want to protect her more.

108
00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:47.650
Just leave it to us.

109
00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:49.170
If a Crown Prince like you

110
00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.240
were attacked,

111
00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:51.560
we'd be in trouble.

112
00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:56.210
Your Highness.

113
00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:06.730
Miss.

114
00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:07.920
Your parents and your brother

115
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:09.320
were already up

116
00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:10.240
long before you.

117
00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.850
My parents have always
been early risers,

118
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.170
but why did my brother

119
00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.210
get up so early?

120
00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.610
He seems to be studying.

121
00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:17.530
He's coming back this time

122
00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.090
to take the examinations.

123
00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.730
He loves to read since he was a child.

124
00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:22.800
He's becoming more and more

125
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.000
of a nerd now.

126
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.560
Miss, it's time to work.

127
00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:35.360
Father.

128
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:38.050
Is this my daughter, Liuli?

129
00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:38.480
Do I look good?

130
00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:40.120
You're so cool.

131
00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:41.320
Father, are you

132
00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:42.770
going to court with me today?

133
00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:43.880
Of course.

134
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.320
I have to accompany
the Ceremonial Officer

135
00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:47.530
to the court.

136
00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:48.970
Great.

137
00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:50.410
However,

138
00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:52.970
father, you are going
to get into a fight

139
00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:54.320
with the officials, are you?

140
00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:55.880
I won't.

141
00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.290
I have other plan.

142
00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:00.360
Where is mother?

143
00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:01.000
Won't she come with us

144
00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:02.050
to court?

145
00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:04.410
Your mother's old injury recurred

146
00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.120
and she has written to His Majesty.

147
00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:08.120
His Majesty is considerate
of your mother

148
00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:09.170
and has decreed that

149
00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.920
she doesn't have to go to court today.

150
00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:13.770
Liuli, it's getting late.

151
00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.800
Let's go to court with me.

152
00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:16.170
Let's go.

153
00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:16.730
Let's go.

154
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.360
Come and take a look.

155
00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:22.680
Take a look.

156
00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:23.770
Take a look.

157
00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:28.320
Is that her?

158
00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:29.410
Yes.

159
00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:37.050
Your Highness.

160
00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:38.440
Princess Hua.

161
00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:42.880
My carriage broke down.

162
00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:45.480
Can you give me a lift?

163
00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.610
Your Highness, it's not convenient.

164
00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:52.440
Why not?

165
00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:53.970
It's not the first time

166
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.210
we got to court together.

167
00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.050
Princess Hua.

168
00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:05.410
Your Highness.

169
00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:07.850
Please sit down.

170
00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:18.800
(I told you not to get in.)

171
00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:20.410
Your Highness.

172
00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.000
My carriage is really broken.

173
00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:25.610
What a coincidence.

174
00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:29.880
Is that

175
00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:32.290
the only carriage you have?

176
00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:34.530
Well,

177
00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:36.680
they complained to my father recently

178
00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:38.010
that I had acted in an outrageous

179
00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:38.960
and wasteful manner.

180
00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:40.960
So I've been thrifty lately.

181
00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:43.800
That's how you should be.

182
00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:46.080
General Hua.

183
00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:47.770
How are you getting on
back in the capital?

184
00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.250
Did you have a good night's rest?

185
00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:50.840
Why are you going to court so soon?

186
00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:52.770
I've been away for many years

187
00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.170
and have just returned.

188
00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:55.890
So of course I must

189
00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:57.490
report to His Majesty at once.

190
00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:58.080
Yes.

191
00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.720
What a lucky day.

192
00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:01.680
I didn't expect

193
00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:04.370
to be in the same carriage as you.

194
00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:05.890
It's fate.

195
00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:08.200
Exactly.

196
00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:20.200
General Hua.

197
00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:23.530
It's not raining outside.

198
00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:28.010
The sky looks clear from here.

199
00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:29.010
Indeed.

200
00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.800
(I wish we could arrive soon.)

201
00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:43.440
Father.

202
00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:45.170
Slow down.

203
00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:46.920
I am in poor health.

204
00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:47.920
All right.

205
00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:48.920
I will help you.

206
00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:49.800
Let me do it.

207
00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:55.290
No need to trouble yourself.

208
00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.960
Then I'll go ahead.

209
00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:00.250
Please, Your Highness.

210
00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:07.800
Grand Preceptor.

211
00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:09.490
It's been a while.

212
00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.080
How are you doing?

213
00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:12.410
I won't get any better.

214
00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:13.840
Grand Preceptor.

215
00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:15.320
Since you are not in good health,

216
00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:16.170
you don't have to

217
00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.320
rush to court.

218
00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:18.170
He's right.

219
00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:20.130
General Hua has returned from victory.

220
00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.680
How could I not come?

221
00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:24.720
Father, look at them.

222
00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:25.600
Liuli.

223
00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:28.130
I have a few words of advice for you.

224
00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:29.920
Our Hua family

225
00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:31.680
must follow our own path.

226
00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:34.080
We are tiny in this vast world.

227
00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:37.050
We must do what is worthy to the Emperor

228
00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:38.840
and to Heaven.

229
00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:40.600
If you focus on

230
00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:42.320
worthless people

231
00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:43.650
and mindless words,

232
00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:46.130
you'll suffer your own troubles.

233
00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:49.130
I get it.

234
00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:52.130
Let's go.

235
00:10:58.440 --> 00:10:59.530
General Hua.

236
00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:01.890
I was right about you.

237
00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:03.800
This time you led the Hua family army

238
00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:04.890
to a great victory over Jinpo.

239
00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:06.680
You've really brought

240
00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:08.560
a great relief to our state.

241
00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.560
The reward for your contribution

242
00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:12.600
is ready for you.

243
00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:15.080
Thank you, Your Majesty.

244
00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:16.960
Since you've returned to the capital,

245
00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:19.840
I must consider

246
00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:21.650
what kind of task

247
00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:23.010
to assign you.

248
00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:24.530
I can't let you idle.

249
00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:25.720
Officials.

250
00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:28.320
Do you have any good suggestions?

251
00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:37.770
Your Majesty, General Hua

252
00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:41.320
has only just returned to the capital

253
00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:43.010
after many years of battle.

254
00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:46.410
I think you should let him

255
00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:49.010
rest for a while.

256
00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:54.200
General Hua, tell me.

257
00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:56.050
Are you tired

258
00:11:56.890 --> 00:11:57.960
after all these years?

259
00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:02.050
Your Majesty, I serve you
and the State of Jin

260
00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:03.960
with all my might

261
00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:05.490
and life.

262
00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:09.440
Still,

263
00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:11.560
you are a great hero.

264
00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:12.530
I can't overwork you.

265
00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:15.650
I've heard that you've suffered

266
00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:18.440
many wounds over the years.

267
00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:21.250
Your Majesty, it is true,

268
00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.170
but I...

269
00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:24.200
All right. It's my bad.

270
00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:25.960
I haven't given you

271
00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:27.840
much time to recuperate

272
00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:29.560
after all these years.

273
00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:35.680
Your Majesty.

274
00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:38.800
I have one more request to make.

275
00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:40.050
Tell me.

276
00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:42.320
Your Majesty.

277
00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:45.320
I have been on the battlefield
for many years

278
00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:48.490
and my health is not
as good as it used to be.

279
00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:51.130
Besides, I was severely wounded

280
00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:53.770
in the last battle with Jinpo

281
00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:56.920
and I can no longer fight

282
00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:58.720
and serve the state.

283
00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:01.050
I hope that you will relieve me

284
00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:02.840
of all my duties.

285
00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:06.650
I wish to retire to my hometown.

286
00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:13.800
General, what are you...

287
00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:17.410
I present to you the Tiger Amulet.

288
00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:20.250
Please grant me permission.

289
00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:21.010
Father.

290
00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:23.370
This...

291
00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:33.650
Fine.

292
00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:35.770
I allow it.

293
00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:42.920
Thank you, Your Majesty.

294
00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:51.920
It's been a long time

295
00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:53.440
since I've had a palace meal.

296
00:13:56.050 --> 00:13:57.490
Who would have thought that General Hua

297
00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:59.490
would leave after serving his purpose?

298
00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:02.370
He and Grand Preceptor Du
had fought all their lives

299
00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:04.170
and this is what they ended up with.

300
00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:06.600
Poor thing.

301
00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:21.010
Grand Preceptor Du.

302
00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:23.920
General Hua.

303
00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:29.560
Let's go.

304
00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:31.530
Let's go.

305
00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:44.490
Your Highness.

306
00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:49.410
Why do you eat so slowly?

307
00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:50.680
Do you think this is your home?

308
00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:52.320
Come on.

309
00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:54.320
Let's go home.

310
00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:56.840
(I didn't speak up for General Hua.)

311
00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:59.050
(Liuli is not mad at me, is she?)

312
00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:04.260
(Hua Mansion)

313
00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:11.080
Quick, help your father down.

314
00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:17.370
Did it went well?

315
00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:18.290
Yes.

316
00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:21.770
Liuli.

317
00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:24.410
It's not like we
came back from a defeat.

318
00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:25.890
As a daughter of the Hua family,

319
00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:27.290
don't behave like this.

320
00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:36.490
Mother.

321
00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:38.840
What are you doing with these baskets?

322
00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:41.010
Show them.

323
00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:42.890
These are gifts

324
00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:43.890
from our neighbours.

325
00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:46.170
There are still many people

326
00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:47.490
who appreciate our great general.

327
00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:01.530
(General Hua's family
has lost its power.)

328
00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:03.130
(Hua Mansion)
(I have to)

329
00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:04.840
(do something for Liuli.)

330
00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:08.770
His Highness

331
00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:10.010
has been standing there
for an hour.

332
00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:45.800
Honey.

333
00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:47.130
Honey.

334
00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:47.890
Hurry up.

335
00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:50.010
Help me.

336
00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:51.010
Honey.

337
00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:52.440
As I said before,

338
00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:54.010
your back is not yet healed.

339
00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:55.890
So you should be careful.

340
00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:57.600
General, madam.

341
00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:59.250
His Highness is here
for your second son.

342
00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:00.410
He's already at the door.

343
00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:04.530
His Highness wants to see Changkong?

344
00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:06.080
When did Changkong

345
00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:07.530
get so acquainted with His Highness?

346
00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:10.770
Is he actually here for Liuli?

347
00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:11.840
Honey.

348
00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:14.880
You let Changkong to
greet His Highness first.

349
00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:16.050
I'll be right back.

350
00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:17.050
All right.

351
00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:27.320
Liuli.

352
00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:30.210
Good morning, father.

353
00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:32.160
Good morning.

354
00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:33.450
Liuli.

355
00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:35.800
You are the current Ceremonial Officer.

356
00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:37.050
The envoy meeting

357
00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:37.690
is very important.

358
00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:39.640
You have to attend it, right?

359
00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:42.930
Actually, it's optional.

360
00:17:43.050 --> 00:17:45.250
You should do your duty as an officer.

361
00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:46.600
So you'd better go.

362
00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:49.930
But I haven't had my breakfast yet.

363
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:51.120
Breakfast?

364
00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:54.080
I have already prepared it for you.

365
00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:55.560
Here. Take it.

366
00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:56.800
Remember.

367
00:17:57.050 --> 00:17:58.360
Don't come back at noon.

368
00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:00.010
Why?

369
00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:01.400
Stop asking.

370
00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:02.840
Leave through the secret passage.

371
00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:05.050
Why should I leave secretly?

372
00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:07.290
An officer

373
00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:08.880
must be as stealthy and fierce

374
00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:10.600
as a soldier in battle.

375
00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:11.800
Enough. No more questions.

376
00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:12.600
Hurry up.

377
00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:13.450
Get her out of here.

378
00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:13.880
Hurry up.

379
00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:14.290
Go.

380
00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:15.360
I don't understand.

381
00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:27.290
Did you come here

382
00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:28.840
to see me?

383
00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:30.840
Your Highness.

384
00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:32.450
Your Highness.

385
00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.560
Did you come here to see me?

386
00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:37.840
Yes, Changkong.

387
00:18:38.290 --> 00:18:39.560
Do you remember how

388
00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:41.250
we used to chat like brothers

389
00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:43.600
when we were children?

390
00:18:46.450 --> 00:18:47.080
No.

391
00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:49.530
I remember when I was a kid,

392
00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:50.640
you stole my candy

393
00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:53.320
and got beaten up by my big brother.

394
00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:03.210
Many years have passed.

395
00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:05.160
It is normal for your memory

396
00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:06.320
to be off.

397
00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:09.360
No wonder.

398
00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:11.490
I had to read

399
00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:12.730
Mencius three times

400
00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:13.730
before I could memorise it.

401
00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:16.320
Oh, no.

402
00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:18.690
I'm not familiar with this place

403
00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:20.560
set up by Liuli.

404
00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:21.600
I'm familiar with it.

405
00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:22.730
Let me lead you the way.

406
00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:24.320
Your Highness.

407
00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:25.970
This is Hua Mansion.

408
00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:27.490
Why are you familiar with it?

409
00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:35.530
I'm just a little familiar with it.

410
00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:39.770
My parents are very happy

411
00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:41.730
to hear that you're here.

412
00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:43.010
They want to

413
00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:45.690
give you a warm welcome.

414
00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:47.930
Your Highness, please.

415
00:19:57.730 --> 00:19:58.360
After you.

416
00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:04.970
Honey.

417
00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:06.250
Be sure to

418
00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:07.690
(Ambitious)
restrain yourself.

419
00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:09.290
Never act rashly.

420
00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:12.770
I have met His Highness

421
00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:13.690
when he was a boy.

422
00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:15.120
Why would I hit him?

423
00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:16.930
If you can't stand it

424
00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:18.800
and want to take it out on me,

425
00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:20.290
please be

426
00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:21.360
a little more gentle

427
00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:23.690
when you do so.

428
00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:25.930
It depends.

429
00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:27.210
Honey, you...

430
00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:30.250
Father, mother.

431
00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:31.600
His Highness is here.

432
00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:41.770
Welcome, Your Highness.

433
00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:43.690
Welcome, Your Highness.

434
00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:45.970
General Hua.

435
00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:46.930
General Wei.

436
00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:49.450
Your Highness, please come in.

437
00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:11.050
(Why don't I see Liuli?)

438
00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:12.970
Your Highness, please have some tea.

439
00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:15.800
Your Highness, please.

440
00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:20.530
I was under the care of

441
00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:21.600
General Hua and General Wei

442
00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:22.930
when I was young.

443
00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:24.400
It's only right for me
to come and visit.

444
00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:26.970
I heard that Changkong
is preparing for the exam.

445
00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:28.210
I had

446
00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:29.930
books on the topic prepared.

447
00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:32.320
Thank you, Your Highness.

448
00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:33.010
No problem.

449
00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:36.490
Your Highness.

450
00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:38.690
Can you show me

451
00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:40.210
what books

452
00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:42.010
you've brought to Changkong?

453
00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:42.880
Ba.

454
00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:48.600
(Examination Ten Do's and Don'ts.)
Examination Ten Do's and Don'ts.

455
00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:50.930
Changkong must know what to expect.

456
00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:52.290
After all, the Hua family

457
00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:54.530
had never taken an imperial exam before.

458
00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:55.970
Honey.

459
00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:57.080
This book is good.

460
00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:00.730
Dietary Guidelines Before Exam.

461
00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:01.600
Changkong.

462
00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:03.840
You need this book.

463
00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:04.800
It's useful.

464
00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:05.490
Yes.

465
00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:09.840
Interesting Tales of the Scholar?

466
00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:11.120
This book...

467
00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:11.970
Well,

468
00:22:12.290 --> 00:22:13.880
Changkong is studying hard for the exam.

469
00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:16.360
It is necessary to read
some jokes occasionally

470
00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:17.770
to relax.

471
00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:19.560
Right, Changkong?

472
00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:22.010
Your Highness, that's brilliant.

473
00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:23.800
Looks like

474
00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:26.080
His Highness is very

475
00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:27.250
considerate of Changkong.

476
00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:30.530
If he does pass his exam,

477
00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:32.930
we'll have to thank

478
00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:35.210
Your Highness.

479
00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:37.250
Changkong, remember.

480
00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:38.490
Be sure to

481
00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:40.210
thank His Highness.

482
00:22:40.690 --> 00:22:41.160
For sure.

483
00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:43.010
Good books.

484
00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:44.930
Why is there

485
00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:46.600
an exquisite dessert box here?

486
00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:51.770
So many delicious snacks.

487
00:22:52.450 --> 00:22:55.400
Are all these snacks

488
00:22:55.490 --> 00:22:56.770
for Changkong?

489
00:22:57.050 --> 00:22:58.800
I think Liuli

490
00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:00.490
likes to eat the haw balls.

491
00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:01.400
It's all right.

492
00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:02.770
I can leave them for her.

493
00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:08.080
His Highness

494
00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:08.800
prepared this for me.

495
00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:09.770
How can I give it to Liuli?

496
00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:10.290
I'll eat them.

497
00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:11.290
They are all mine.

498
00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:12.800
His Highness

499
00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:14.400
knows you're slow.

500
00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:16.450
So he's got plenty of nuts

501
00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:18.120
for you to refresh your brain.

502
00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:18.840
Yes.

503
00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:21.730
Good.

504
00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:30.880
(The Capital)
Why did the Moses come so early?

505
00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:31.800
(The Capital)

506
00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:33.450
(The Capital)
It's all because

507
00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:33.730
(The Capital)

508
00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:35.080
(The Capital)
we beat Jinpo.

509
00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:36.970
(If the envoys)

510
00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:38.600
(learnt that my father had retired,)

511
00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:40.320
(I wonder if they'd be eyeing)

512
00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:41.360
(the State of Jin again.)

513
00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:43.250
Miss, what are you thinking?

514
00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:45.080
Do you remember

515
00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:46.730
how hard it was for us

516
00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:49.640
to exchange clearance
documents with the Moses

517
00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:50.930
at the border?

518
00:23:51.250 --> 00:23:52.600
I still hold a grudge.

519
00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:54.080
The Moses

520
00:23:54.210 --> 00:23:55.530
are so arrogant.

521
00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:57.600
We had to wait so long

522
00:23:57.730 --> 00:23:59.160
and they demanded a red packet

523
00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:00.210
attached to the clearance document

524
00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:01.730
or they would never respond.

525
00:24:02.010 --> 00:24:03.010
Today we can finally

526
00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:03.970
avenge the insult.

527
00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:06.770
I have

528
00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:08.770
my own standard.

529
00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:11.080
If they do not comply,
they will not pass.

530
00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:25.260
(Qunying Eatery)

531
00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:32.290
(I swore)

532
00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:33.400
(I'd never come here again.)

533
00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:34.530
(Why am I here?)

534
00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:46.840
I am here to check the accounts.

535
00:24:49.050 --> 00:24:50.290
It's been a long time

536
00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:51.600
since you showed up.

537
00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:54.840
I figured

538
00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:56.730
it's just a small shop anyway.

539
00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:58.160
So I'll just

540
00:24:58.250 --> 00:24:59.080
take care of it for my father.

541
00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:00.080
It doesn't make much profit either.

542
00:25:00.490 --> 00:25:01.210
So...

543
00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:03.360
I'm leaving.

544
00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:05.600
Princess.

545
00:25:09.210 --> 00:25:09.980
Would you like to

546
00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:11.250
have a meal with me?

547
00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:14.690
(I must not turn around.)

548
00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:15.880
(Don't turn back.)

549
00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:17.160
(Don't turn back.)

550
00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:20.640
I'm done.

551
00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:24.050
Already?

552
00:25:25.930 --> 00:25:27.450
I've been eating a lot lately.

553
00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:29.120
I've gained weight.

554
00:25:33.050 --> 00:25:34.250
You're right.

555
00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:38.050
Enjoy your meal.

556
00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:39.290
I'll look at the account book.

557
00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:45.080
Have you heard?

558
00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:47.490
General Hua resigned at court.

559
00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:50.080
What? Resigned?

560
00:25:53.050 --> 00:25:54.160
I think that

561
00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:55.640
General Hua's move

562
00:25:55.770 --> 00:25:56.880
has actually solved the biggest problem

563
00:25:56.970 --> 00:25:58.600
for the Hua family at the moment.

564
00:25:58.770 --> 00:26:00.970
My mother has always worried

565
00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:02.290
that the Hua family is too overwhelming.

566
00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:03.880
Now

567
00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:05.880
at least my father

568
00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:07.690
will no longer be
so wary of the Hua family

569
00:26:08.770 --> 00:26:09.970
and this should

570
00:26:10.050 --> 00:26:11.360
relieve my mother of a great worry.

571
00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:15.560
So what are you trying to say?

572
00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:16.970
Well,

573
00:26:17.970 --> 00:26:20.640
if I can marry Princess Hua,

574
00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:22.400
there should be no problem.

575
00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:25.880
What are you talking about?

576
00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:28.080
Princess Hua

577
00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:29.450
has gone to such lengths

578
00:26:29.730 --> 00:26:31.490
to be with me

579
00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:33.690
and even forced her family to resign.

580
00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:36.210
So I mustn't

581
00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:37.840
let her down either.

582
00:26:39.690 --> 00:26:40.450
Are you sure?

583
00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:42.800
I'm telling you

584
00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:43.800
about this

585
00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:45.210
because I hope

586
00:26:45.290 --> 00:26:46.490
you won't be too upset.

587
00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:50.120
After all, the marriage between
the Hua family and me

588
00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:51.880
is already decided.

589
00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:53.800
Upset, my foot!

590
00:26:54.010 --> 00:26:54.600
You...

591
00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:57.360
How could you say such harsh words?

592
00:26:57.490 --> 00:26:58.320
I didn't say it before

593
00:26:58.360 --> 00:26:59.450
because I was holding back.

594
00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:00.730
You never had me in your mind anyway.

595
00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:01.770
It is someone else.

596
00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:03.010
But I'm sorry,

597
00:27:03.010 --> 00:27:04.050
I don't care anymore

598
00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:05.010
and I'm not interested.

599
00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:09.320
By the way,

600
00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:11.450
(Account Book)
you said you'd pay me for

601
00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:11.530
(Account Book)

602
00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:13.120
(Account Book)
the loss of Qunying Eatery.

603
00:27:13.210 --> 00:27:14.290
Don't tell me you are

604
00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:15.530
not a man of your word.

605
00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:19.840
I...

606
00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:48.770
Your Highness,

607
00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:50.210
I'm grateful

608
00:27:50.290 --> 00:27:51.690
that you've come to visit me,

609
00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:53.010
but you don't have to

610
00:27:53.050 --> 00:27:54.250
study with me.

611
00:27:54.730 --> 00:27:55.730
Changkong.

612
00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:57.210
We are brothers.

613
00:27:57.490 --> 00:27:58.450
The whole capital knows

614
00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:00.290
that I've always been idle.

615
00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:02.840
Princess Hua is working so tirelessly

616
00:28:03.010 --> 00:28:05.320
to handle the envoy meeting.

617
00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:06.400
So it's only right that

618
00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:07.320
I accompany you.

619
00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:09.970
Then I'll continue my studies.

620
00:28:11.450 --> 00:28:12.120
Go ahead.

621
00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:24.800
Changkong.

622
00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:28.450
How long have you been studying?

623
00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:33.490
My father said

624
00:28:33.770 --> 00:28:34.880
that in the long term,

625
00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:36.210
although the rule of
military is important,

626
00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:38.080
we must not lose the rule of civil.

627
00:28:38.690 --> 00:28:40.400
My family has been
warriors for generations.

628
00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:41.930
My elder brother and sister-in-law

629
00:28:42.050 --> 00:28:42.930
have been stationed at the border.

630
00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:45.290
Only I am interested in studying

631
00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:46.320
since I was little.

632
00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:49.050
So my father told me to study hard

633
00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:50.530
and do what I wanted to do.

634
00:28:55.970 --> 00:28:56.600
Your Highness.

635
00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:03.490
Your Highness?

636
00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:10.080
Your Highness.

637
00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:16.050
Did you hear what I just said?

638
00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:19.770
You are absolutely right.

639
00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:23.290
So

640
00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:24.640
what did you just ask me?

641
00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:32.930
I'm really here to visit you.

642
00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:44.220
(Baiyu Hall)

643
00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:53.640
Miss, you've worked so hard.

644
00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:02.050
I am an official now.

645
00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:03.640
It's my duty.

646
00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:05.600
It's just that today

647
00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:07.690
I've been standing around
all day for no reason.

648
00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:09.010
I'm so pissed off.

649
00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:14.160
Would you like some more?

650
00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:15.360
No.

651
00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:17.320
I have to save my stomach

652
00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:19.010
for father's cooking.

653
00:30:19.530 --> 00:30:20.640
I wonder

654
00:30:20.690 --> 00:30:22.050
what he has cooked today.

655
00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:41.210
Your Highness.

656
00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:49.530
Your Highness.

657
00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:54.530
General Hua, General Wei.

658
00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:56.250
Your Highness.

659
00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:57.970
It's getting late.

660
00:30:58.450 --> 00:30:59.970
Why don't you have dinner here

661
00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:02.160
before you leave?

662
00:31:02.690 --> 00:31:04.010
It's just that the food here

663
00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:05.880
may not be

664
00:31:06.250 --> 00:31:07.770
quite to your liking.

665
00:31:08.050 --> 00:31:08.880
Yes.

666
00:31:08.970 --> 00:31:10.800
Our humble meals

667
00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:11.970
are no match for

668
00:31:12.010 --> 00:31:13.050
the royal banquet.

669
00:31:14.290 --> 00:31:15.400
I'm not a picky eater.

670
00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:17.160
Thank you, generals.

671
00:31:19.970 --> 00:31:21.160
I heard that

672
00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:23.360
you live quite a distance

673
00:31:23.530 --> 00:31:24.600
from the western suburbs.

674
00:31:24.730 --> 00:31:26.290
If the dinner is late,

675
00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:27.730
will it disrupt

676
00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:29.290
your rest?

677
00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:29.930
Yes.

678
00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:30.970
My wife and I

679
00:31:31.010 --> 00:31:33.690
worry that you are tired.

680
00:31:33.730 --> 00:31:35.120
Thank you for your concerns.

681
00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:36.800
I'm still young.

682
00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:37.970
Evenings

683
00:31:38.010 --> 00:31:39.730
are when my energy is at its peak.

684
00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:41.160
It's okay.

685
00:31:43.770 --> 00:31:44.600
Changkong.

686
00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:46.400
Read those books

687
00:31:46.490 --> 00:31:48.400
I gave you today when you are free.

688
00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:50.360
They might come in handy.

689
00:31:50.930 --> 00:31:52.490
Especially this one.

690
00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:53.530
Did you read it?

691
00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:56.210
I haven't had time to read it yet.

692
00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:57.690
This is it.

693
00:31:59.250 --> 00:32:00.050
Look.

694
00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:01.730
Your Highness.

695
00:32:01.930 --> 00:32:03.290
In that case,

696
00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:06.640
I'll have the servants
to serve the dinner.

697
00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:08.560
Thank you.

698
00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:09.600
Okay.

699
00:32:09.770 --> 00:32:11.210
I'll leave you to it.

700
00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:26.970
Honey.

701
00:32:27.290 --> 00:32:29.210
Do you think my earlier guess

702
00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:30.400
were right?

703
00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:33.800
I had my doubts before,

704
00:32:34.050 --> 00:32:36.080
but now I'm sure.

705
00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:40.530
Judging by His Highness's
words and actions,

706
00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:42.050
he is up to something else.

707
00:32:42.290 --> 00:32:43.290
If he doesn't

708
00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:44.490
see Liuli today,

709
00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:45.530
he won't leave.

710
00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:49.450
I haven't seen
His Highness for many years.

711
00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:51.250
He's grown up

712
00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:52.970
and is much more handsome now.

713
00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:55.320
He is indeed much more handsome.

714
00:32:55.770 --> 00:32:56.970
His features

715
00:32:57.050 --> 00:32:58.800
are exactly your daughter's type.

716
00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:01.080
My daughter?

717
00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:02.360
She is your daughter, too.

718
00:33:03.210 --> 00:33:03.970
Enough.

719
00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:05.490
I'm not in the mood

720
00:33:05.530 --> 00:33:06.320
to argue with you now.

721
00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:11.320
I've met Song Guang

722
00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:12.080
and asked him.

723
00:33:12.770 --> 00:33:15.080
Maybe it isn't just His Highness

724
00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:16.880
who wants to come.

725
00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:20.400
Our daughter has grown up.

726
00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:22.290
It's time she married someone.

727
00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:24.690
However,

728
00:33:24.770 --> 00:33:26.530
how can she be so bold

729
00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:29.880
that even the Crown Prince

730
00:33:29.930 --> 00:33:31.530
is all over her?

731
00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:33.320
Do you think this is funny?

732
00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:33.560
You...

733
00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:34.400
As expected of

734
00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:36.250
my good daughter.

735
00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:38.290
I'm worried that she might really

736
00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:39.930
fall in love with His Highness.

737
00:33:40.730 --> 00:33:42.080
You're right.

738
00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:43.530
If my daughter

739
00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:44.690
marries into the palace,

740
00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:46.080
I can't see her

741
00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:47.690
suffering.

742
00:33:48.210 --> 00:33:50.530
That's what I'm worried about.

743
00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:54.210
Rumour has it that

744
00:33:54.250 --> 00:33:55.840
His Highness is temperamental.

745
00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:57.640
If Liuli was gentle and tolerant,

746
00:33:57.840 --> 00:33:59.360
then there would be no problem,

747
00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:00.690
but her temperament...

748
00:34:01.530 --> 00:34:01.970
Well,

749
00:34:02.050 --> 00:34:03.530
- she's just like you.
- She's just like you.

750
00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:16.080
Yuan Wei, I'm starving.

751
00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:16.680
Let's go back for dinner.

752
00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:17.810
Miss.

753
00:34:17.970 --> 00:34:18.680
Welcome home.

754
00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:20.010
Uncle Song.

755
00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:21.680
You must be tired.

756
00:34:21.970 --> 00:34:22.890
I'm exhausted.

757
00:34:22.970 --> 00:34:24.120
Well, the general

758
00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:25.160
has cooked

759
00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:26.330
some of your favourite dishes.

760
00:34:26.450 --> 00:34:26.930
You should

761
00:34:27.010 --> 00:34:28.050
go to your room first.

762
00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:28.600
I'll bring

763
00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:29.680
the dinner to you later.

764
00:34:29.850 --> 00:34:30.530
Did my dad cook?

765
00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:31.410
Yes.

766
00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:32.200
Yuan Wei.

767
00:34:32.410 --> 00:34:33.200
What are you waiting for?

768
00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:34.530
Take her to her room.

769
00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:35.560
Let's go.

770
00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:36.200
Hurry up.

771
00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:37.120
Let's go.

772
00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:38.450
I'm so tired.

773
00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:03.410
Your Highness.

774
00:35:05.050 --> 00:35:06.330
Eat up.

775
00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:08.200
(Finish your meal and leave.)

776
00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:14.280
The last time I had a meal with you

777
00:35:14.890 --> 00:35:15.530
was 15 years ago.

778
00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:16.760
Your Highness.

779
00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:18.930
Eat up.

780
00:35:25.410 --> 00:35:26.850
Won't we wait for Princess Hua?

781
00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:28.850
Liuli hasn't come back yet.

782
00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:29.560
We can't

783
00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:30.930
keep you waiting either.

784
00:35:31.010 --> 00:35:32.370
Let's eat first.

785
00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:33.490
Your Highness.

786
00:35:33.810 --> 00:35:34.970
Eat up.

787
00:35:41.810 --> 00:35:43.010
General Hua, Changkong.

788
00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:44.010
You guys should eat, too.

789
00:35:51.010 --> 00:35:52.370
You may eat.

790
00:35:52.970 --> 00:35:53.560
Let's eat.

791
00:35:53.810 --> 00:35:54.200
Let's eat.

792
00:36:01.010 --> 00:36:01.970
Your Highness.

793
00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:03.410
The Hua family always has

794
00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:05.080
a tradition.

795
00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:06.890
Women

796
00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:08.640
have the say in the house.

797
00:36:08.890 --> 00:36:10.680
Your Highness, I hope you don't mind.

798
00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:14.850
Sure.

799
00:36:15.930 --> 00:36:16.930
That's for sure.

800
00:36:19.330 --> 00:36:22.450
I'll have a drink first.

801
00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:32.050
Here.

802
00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:33.560
I also studied swordsmanship

803
00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:34.850
with the Hua family for a few months.

804
00:36:35.330 --> 00:36:36.530
General Hua,

805
00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:38.080
you are my teacher.

806
00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:40.720
Your Highness.

807
00:36:41.490 --> 00:36:43.530
How is your swordsmanship now?

808
00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:45.640
After you left,

809
00:36:45.810 --> 00:36:47.240
my father arranged for someone else

810
00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:48.490
to teach me swordsmanship.

811
00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:49.930
However, those people

812
00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:51.450
are no match for you.

813
00:36:55.410 --> 00:36:56.810
I'll drink to

814
00:36:57.120 --> 00:36:58.160
the memory of that time.

815
00:37:04.450 --> 00:37:06.600
Your Highness, you are quite a drinker.

816
00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:09.890
Since you have a high tolerance,

817
00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:12.890
I'll drink with you today.

818
00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:14.890
Changkong, take a big bowl

819
00:37:14.970 --> 00:37:16.080
and pour the liquor.

820
00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:18.120
His Highness and I will get wasted.

821
00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:18.560
Okay.

822
00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:29.720
Your Highness, please.

823
00:37:30.050 --> 00:37:31.200
Here's a toast

824
00:37:33.370 --> 00:37:34.970
to the return of the two generals

825
00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:36.450
of the Hua family.

826
00:37:36.890 --> 00:37:38.410
I would like to thank His Majesty

827
00:37:38.530 --> 00:37:40.010
for his kindness to the Hua family

828
00:37:40.450 --> 00:37:41.560
over the years.

829
00:37:41.850 --> 00:37:45.080
I'll drink to that.

830
00:38:06.370 --> 00:38:07.810
You are a drinker.

831
00:38:08.410 --> 00:38:09.240
Changkong.

832
00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:10.330
Fill up the bowl.

833
00:38:10.810 --> 00:38:11.760
Yes, father.

834
00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:14.810
Miss.

835
00:38:15.410 --> 00:38:16.930
This is from Young Master.

836
00:38:16.970 --> 00:38:17.720
Open it up.

837
00:38:17.810 --> 00:38:18.930
What is this?

838
00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:25.280
It can turn.

839
00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:26.760
Interesting.

840
00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:29.890
By the way, what are my parents doing?

841
00:38:30.010 --> 00:38:30.410
Why didn't they

842
00:38:30.490 --> 00:38:31.560
have dinner with me today?

843
00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:33.330
We have a guest today.

844
00:38:33.370 --> 00:38:34.490
Your parents

845
00:38:34.530 --> 00:38:35.600
figured you were working too hard.

846
00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:37.450
So they didn't want you to bother.

847
00:38:38.330 --> 00:38:40.330
But I'm so bored.

848
00:38:41.010 --> 00:38:42.330
Why don't you read the book

849
00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:43.970
given by Princess Jiamin?

850
00:38:44.050 --> 00:38:44.680
No.

851
00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:46.490
Those are for foolish ladies.

852
00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:48.680
Why do you say that about yourself?

853
00:38:51.410 --> 00:38:52.490
Then read this.

854
00:38:52.850 --> 00:38:54.280
I got this from Young Master.

855
00:38:55.850 --> 00:38:58.490
Interesting Tales of the Scholar?

856
00:39:02.970 --> 00:39:04.370
This is quite interesting.

857
00:39:07.050 --> 00:39:07.640
Your Highness.

858
00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:13.280
Why hasn't Princess Hua come back yet?

859
00:39:23.810 --> 00:39:25.560
Perhaps she was too tired

860
00:39:25.890 --> 00:39:27.600
and went straight to her room to rest.

861
00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:35.240
Your Highness.

862
00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:40.970
I've collected some interesting things

863
00:39:41.010 --> 00:39:42.330
in Qinghan Prefecture.

864
00:39:42.410 --> 00:39:44.720
His Majesty was very interested

865
00:39:44.810 --> 00:39:46.200
in this in earlier years.

866
00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:49.120
I just don't know if in recent years...

867
00:39:54.330 --> 00:39:56.930
If I were to present it in person,

868
00:39:56.970 --> 00:39:59.160
I'd be a bit awkward.

869
00:40:01.530 --> 00:40:04.080
I would be grateful if you could

870
00:40:04.450 --> 00:40:06.080
present it to His Majesty for me.

871
00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:10.760
Your Highness.

872
00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:20.890
I will bring it to him.

873
00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:21.970
Don't worry.

874
00:40:22.410 --> 00:40:23.890
Thank you, Your Highness.

875
00:40:24.330 --> 00:40:27.370
Let me see you off.

876
00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:31.680
Thank you for
your hospitality, generals.

877
00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:34.450
I'll get going.

878
00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:40.330
(Ambitious)

879
00:40:40.330 --> 00:40:41.330
Why isn't he out yet?

880
00:40:41.370 --> 00:40:42.080
I don't know.

881
00:40:51.490 --> 00:40:51.890
Your Highness.

882
00:40:51.930 --> 00:40:52.450
Your Highness.

883
00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:06.050
(The second floor is clearly lit.)

884
00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:07.930
(It seems that
the Hua family is determined)

885
00:41:08.010 --> 00:41:09.050
(not to let me see you.)

886
00:41:11.370 --> 00:41:13.200
Bring me ink and paper.

887
00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:14.240
Yes, Your Highness.

888
00:41:20.410 --> 00:41:21.720
(I wonder what Liuli)

889
00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:23.200
(is doing now.)

890
00:41:26.410 --> 00:41:27.680
(I wonder what His Highness)

891
00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:28.890
(is doing now.)

892
00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:35.720
Miss.

893
00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:38.160
I know you're bored.

894
00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:40.410
Miss.

895
00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:43.050
Miss, what are you thinking?

896
00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:44.720
His Highness.

897
00:41:49.490 --> 00:41:50.720
Who dares

898
00:41:50.810 --> 00:41:51.930
to break my window?

899
00:41:51.970 --> 00:41:53.490
Who is so rude?

900
00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:55.080
If I catch you,

901
00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:56.640
I'll break your legs.

902
00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:01.280
What is this?

903
00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:03.450
Miss, look.

904
00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:08.060
(Back of the hill.)

905
00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:09.240
Back of the hill?

906
00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:15.500
(Pretentious Hour)

907
00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:18.930
Let me see you off.

908
00:42:21.490 --> 00:42:23.330
Thank you for
your hospitality, generals.

909
00:42:24.450 --> 00:42:25.810
I'll get going.

910
00:42:36.890 --> 00:42:38.850
His Highness is so vigorous today.

911
00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:41.160
