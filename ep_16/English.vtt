17
00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.410
Don't tell me she won't come.

18
00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:11.530
Probably not.

19
00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.010
No way.

20
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.440
I don't believe it.

21
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:19.940
She will come.

22
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.290
Who said I won't come?

23
00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:30.090
Princess Hua.

24
00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.730
Princess Hua.

25
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.970
Be careful.

26
00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:36.410
Princess Hua.

27
00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.250
I finally see you.

28
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.640
I've been waiting at
your house all day today,

29
00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.010
but you didn't show up.

30
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.730
Liuli.

31
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.480
- What are they doing up there?
- This is tiring.

32
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:03.410
Why don't you ask?

33
00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.410
She is a short temper.

34
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.040
I'll give you half my pay.

35
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:08.730
You go and ask.

36
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:10.530
Yuan Wei.

37
00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:11.920
Do you know what His Highness

38
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.810
and Princess Hua are talking about?

39
00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:15.320
What are they talking about?

40
00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.820
It's none of your business.

41
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.190
You just wrote, "back of the hill".

42
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:21.950
You could drive our horse to death.

43
00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.100
It is

44
00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.820
a full moon today.

45
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.260
Yes. There are a lot of stars, too.

46
00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:43.140
Your Highness.

47
00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:44.510
Did you have a drink with my father?

48
00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:49.140
Yes.

49
00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.910
General Hua's liquor
tolerance is truly amazing.

50
00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:53.510
I almost passed out.

51
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.950
I was told that

52
00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.310
you were too tired

53
00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:59.380
and went straight to your room.

54
00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:00.380
So I didn't want to bother you.

55
00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:01.310
Yes.

56
00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:02.230
The envoys

57
00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:03.660
were arriving one after another.

58
00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.140
After I settled them

59
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:06.380
into Longjing House,

60
00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.470
I entertained them.

61
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.140
It was a bit tough.

62
00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:10.790
Then I'll get you some men tomorrow.

63
00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:11.910
You are the Ceremonial Officer.

64
00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.230
You don't have to do
everything personally.

65
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:17.260
Did you come to my house today

66
00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.340
to catch up with my family?

67
00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.750
Yes.

68
00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.870
I just wanted to visit

69
00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:27.950
your family.

70
00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:29.070
But when our family

71
00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:30.820
moved away from the capital,

72
00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.190
you were

73
00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:33.950
just a child.

74
00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:37.980
That's right.

75
00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.220
Did my family treat you well?

76
00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:43.140
Of course.

77
00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.110
They were very kind to me.

78
00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:46.990
That's a relief.

79
00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.700
By the way,

80
00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:50.140
this is

81
00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:51.900
the haw balls my brother

82
00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:52.990
got for me.

83
00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.750
It's delicious.

84
00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:55.550
Try it.

85
00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:56.510
Take this, too.

86
00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:05.460
Is it good?

87
00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:11.580
Yes.

88
00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.550
By the way,

89
00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.430
I've given you some jewellery today.

90
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.550
If General Wei doesn't like it,

91
00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:19.220
remember to take it back.

92
00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.430
Are they for me?

93
00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:24.750
Of course.

94
00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:27.700
Actually,

95
00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:30.220
I'd like to thank you

96
00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:31.950
for the butterfly you made for me.

97
00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:33.750
I slept at night

98
00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:35.510
and dreamed of my mother.

99
00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.110
Really?

100
00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:39.630
She said

101
00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:42.190
it wasn't because of
the incense I offered,

102
00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.310
but because a butterfly

103
00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:45.260
came to her.

104
00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.510
So you went to

105
00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.260
honour your mother that day.

106
00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:52.580
Actually,

107
00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:56.670
I am envious

108
00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:59.260
of your family.

109
00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:04.780
His Highness's mother.

110
00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:06.870
Don't worry.

111
00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.110
My family and I

112
00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:10.260
will take good care of

113
00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:11.380
His Highness.

114
00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:31.990
Why do you think

115
00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:34.190
I was so happy

116
00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:36.380
when His Highness said he actually

117
00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:38.580
paid respects to his mother?

118
00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:41.260
Happy.

119
00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:43.110
Besides,

120
00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:45.580
he asked me to go to the back
of the hill at this hour.

121
00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:47.100
Not only did I go,

122
00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:49.900
I was so happy.

123
00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:52.990
Happy.

124
00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:54.780
Do you think

125
00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:58.380
I have

126
00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.700
a feeling for His Highness?

127
00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:12.990
Two buns and one deep-fried dough stick.

128
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:13.870
Are you even

129
00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:15.460
listening to me?

130
00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:17.950
Miss.

131
00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:20.380
You've repeated it 50 times.

132
00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:22.700
Please let me go.

133
00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:24.430
You can talk to your brother

134
00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:26.110
or Uncle Song.

135
00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:28.020
Just let me go, please.

136
00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:29.070
Miss.

137
00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:54.220
Young Master Yun, you are awake.

138
00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:56.020
Slowly.

139
00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:56.700
Let me help you.

140
00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:05.310
Don't say a word.

141
00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:06.630
Drink the medicine first.

142
00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:11.670
Here.

143
00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:15.460
Sorry, it's hot.

144
00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:16.260
I...

145
00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:17.110
It's okay.

146
00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:19.520
I'm fine.

147
00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:34.790
Here.

148
00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:38.860
I'm sorry, Young Master Yun.

149
00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:40.740
I didn't mean it.

150
00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:41.820
I...

151
00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:43.310
I'll drink it myself.

152
00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:58.550
I have always thought

153
00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:00.100
you were

154
00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:01.460
a weak girl who only
stayed in your room,

155
00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:02.580
but now I realised that

156
00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:04.220
you are

157
00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:05.790
a virtuous lady.

158
00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:08.860
I misjudged you.

159
00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:12.310
A lady is all about manners and
a gentleman is all about righteousness.

160
00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:14.070
There is no conflict between the two.

161
00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:17.030
Don't take it to heart.

162
00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:19.030
After all, we all can get it wrong

163
00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:20.100
at the first time.

164
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:21.950
Then

165
00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:24.070
what do you think of me?

166
00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:26.500
You may be

167
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:28.310
doing something dangerous,

168
00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:29.910
but I can tell from your music

169
00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:31.500
that you have a great sense

170
00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:32.860
of righteousness.

171
00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:43.340
What is this?

172
00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:45.580
Please give this jade whistle

173
00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:46.670
to Princess Hua

174
00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:47.950
and ask her

175
00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:50.500
to pass it to His Highness.

176
00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:53.070
Do you want Princess Hua
to pass it to His Highness?

177
00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:57.500
I don't think this is appropriate.

178
00:09:57.950 --> 00:09:59.150
Rest assured.

179
00:09:59.220 --> 00:09:59.980
You can do it.

180
00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:02.550
I'll explain it to you

181
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:04.910
when you have completed this task.

182
00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:13.310
Young Master Yun bore the disgrace

183
00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:14.820
and was lurking around the Crown Prince

184
00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:16.310
to seek revenge
against the State of Jin.

185
00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:17.140
Jinpo has always

186
00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:18.460
been at odds with the State of Jin.

187
00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:21.220
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

188
00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:27.070
I certainly intend to
make friends with him.

189
00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:57.030
What do you think of her?

190
00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:58.430
She's good.

191
00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:00.310
There are just a bunch of

192
00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:02.390
bored musicians at Jinling Garden.

193
00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:05.460
It's not a classy place at all.

194
00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:08.150
This place is more interesting.

195
00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:23.460
Yun Han

196
00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:24.950
is indeed one of our own.

197
00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:26.910
According to you,

198
00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:29.030
he did not agree to cooperate.

199
00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:31.070
(Qing Yue?)

200
00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:32.220
Yes.

201
00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:34.070
Since he refused,

202
00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:36.550
I have to kill him.

203
00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:40.100
Since he's a rebel,

204
00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:41.790
he can be eliminated.

205
00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:43.500
However,

206
00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:46.070
he must have escaped.

207
00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:55.460
Master.

208
00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:02.670
If Yun Han appears,

209
00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:04.500
I will inform you

210
00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:06.070
to kill him.

211
00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:48.270
This place has been discovered.

212
00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:51.030
You must have been followed.

213
00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:53.860
I need to move again.

214
00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:58.390
Now

215
00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:00.030
you can't go back to
Jinling Garden either.

216
00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:01.390
Why don't you move with us?

217
00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:12.150
(Ankang Garden)

218
00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:14.310
Qing Yue is Yun Han's attendant.

219
00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:16.030
He's the one who sold Yun Han out.

220
00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:17.620
And behind Qing Yue

221
00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:18.540
may well be

222
00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:19.910
the person you've been looking for.

223
00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:21.150
He Yuanting

224
00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:22.340
seems to be trying to find this person

225
00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:23.460
through Yun Han.

226
00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:25.070
Your Highness.

227
00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:25.950
It all

228
00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:26.980
ties together.

229
00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:29.580
I'm afraid

230
00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:31.340
that Yun Han deliberately

231
00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:33.390
gave the wrong information

232
00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:34.910
because we've been
watching Princess Hua.

233
00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:37.620
Your Highness.

234
00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:39.460
You need to make

235
00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:40.270
a real decision now.

236
00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:42.310
Kill that Qing Yue.

237
00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:44.220
Take everything out

238
00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:45.030
of his room.

239
00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:47.950
The best way to protect Yun Han

240
00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:50.900
is to make him
disappear without a trace.

241
00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:52.390
This...

242
00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:55.310
Since Yun Han

243
00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:56.980
Since Yun Han didn't work
with He Yuanting,

244
00:13:57.620 --> 00:13:59.100
he's still my man.

245
00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:00.950
I can ignore

246
00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:03.700
all his previous mistakes.

247
00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:06.910
He has to come back alive.

248
00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:08.790
Then

249
00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:10.550
was it Yun Han who had eliminated

250
00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:11.860
all the undercover spies?

251
00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:13.390
Yes.

252
00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:13.980
But...

253
00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:17.550
That's too cruel.

254
00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:20.430
Have you ever thought

255
00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:22.950
that this is actually Yun Han's

256
00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:23.950
plea for help in disguise?

257
00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:27.950
When Princess Hua was kidnapped,

258
00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:29.980
dispatching all the black-armored army

259
00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:32.270
would certainly alert
the Imperial Court,

260
00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:36.030
but even if the spies were discovered,

261
00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:38.860
it would be impossible
to eliminate them all.

262
00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:41.190
I guess

263
00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:43.460
Yun Han was trying to
hoodwink the other side with this,

264
00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:44.340
which could lead to

265
00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:45.910
a very suspicious point

266
00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:48.950
and hoped we'd look into it.

267
00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:52.620
But probing will lead

268
00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:54.100
to death, Your Highness.

269
00:14:57.550 --> 00:14:58.190
Maybe

270
00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:01.820
he's testing my sincerity.

271
00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:03.910
Life and death

272
00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:05.190
are at my fingertips.

273
00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:09.150
Go now.

274
00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:12.670
Yes.

275
00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:13.820
Be safe.

276
00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:22.500
(Yun Han.)

277
00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:25.030
(You have shed blood for me)

278
00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:26.460
(all these years.)

279
00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:29.120
(I have faith in you.)

280
00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:31.360
(So don't fail me.)

281
00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:38.180
(Hua Mansion)

282
00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:52.550
Du.

283
00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:53.500
Liuli.

284
00:15:57.740 --> 00:15:59.190
Are you here to see me?

285
00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:01.670
Liuli.

286
00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:03.310
May I have a word?

287
00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:05.340
Wait here.

288
00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:06.950
Come here.

289
00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:11.460
I came in haste,

290
00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:12.700
unprepared

291
00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:14.270
and unannounced.

292
00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:16.580
Please forgive my rudeness.

293
00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:17.700
It's fine.

294
00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:18.460
You can come to me

295
00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:19.500
anytime you want.

296
00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:21.270
I'm glad to see you.

297
00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:23.580
Why do you want to see me?

298
00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:26.270
I...

299
00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:34.910
Please pass this

300
00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:36.700
to His Highness.

301
00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:38.910
His Highness?

302
00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:42.500
Why don't you give it

303
00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:43.500
to him yourself?

304
00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:45.270
No, Liuli.

305
00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:46.500
Don't get me wrong.

306
00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:46.860
I...

307
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:48.390
This is not

308
00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:49.860
a token of love or something.

309
00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:51.460
Trust me.

310
00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:53.030
A token of love?

311
00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:54.980
No.

312
00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:55.430
This...

313
00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:57.310
This is really not a token of love.

314
00:16:57.460 --> 00:16:57.860
I...

315
00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:00.600
How should I explain it?

316
00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:01.070
I...

317
00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:04.110
Anyway,

318
00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:04.980
I didn't ask you

319
00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:06.260
to bring this to His Highness

320
00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:08.150
just because I like him.

321
00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:09.060
Just help me

322
00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:10.460
pass this to him.

323
00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:11.500
Xiuying.

324
00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:13.350
I'm getting more confused.

325
00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:14.180
What exactly is

326
00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:15.460
a token of love?

327
00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:21.060
If a man and a woman

328
00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:22.700
are deeply in love,

329
00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:24.150
they give each other a token,

330
00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:25.540
it means

331
00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:28.220
they like each other.

332
00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:32.910
I always give His Highness

333
00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:33.590
snacks.

334
00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:35.300
Is that also a token of love?

335
00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:39.590
If you think it is,

336
00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:40.540
then yes.

337
00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:50.100
(Ankang Garden)

338
00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:55.740
(If a man and a woman)

339
00:17:55.910 --> 00:17:57.350
(are deeply in love,)

340
00:17:57.630 --> 00:17:58.980
(they give each other a token,)

341
00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:02.220
(it means they like each other.)

342
00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:12.830
Princess Hua.

343
00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:24.300
What's wrong?

344
00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:25.300
Nothing.

345
00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:26.740
I...

346
00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:28.150
Well,

347
00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:29.460
Xiuying asked me to pass you this.

348
00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:33.430
(This is Yun Han's jade whistle.)

349
00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:35.390
(Why was it with Lady Du?)

350
00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:37.150
(Could it be...)

351
00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:38.830
Miss.

352
00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:41.460
Did His Highness

353
00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:42.500
bully you?

354
00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:46.020
Yuan Wei.

355
00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:47.190
I think...

356
00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:50.020
I think I like His Highness.

357
00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:52.780
Miss.

358
00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:53.740
Let me ask you a question.

359
00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:54.460
Sure.

360
00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:55.350
Do you like me?

361
00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:55.910
Yes.

362
00:18:55.910 --> 00:18:56.780
Do you like your brother?

363
00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:57.420
Yes.

364
00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:58.900
You like so many people.

365
00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:00.020
What's so special about

366
00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:01.140
you being fond of His Highness?

367
00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:03.060
At best, you just

368
00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:05.220
turn an enemy into a friend.

369
00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:07.020
But...

370
00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:09.950
Is that so?

371
00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:10.900
Of course.

372
00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:11.620
Let's go back.

373
00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:27.190
Put your outfit back on.

374
00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:28.190
I'm sorry.

375
00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:31.500
It was rude of me.

376
00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:33.740
Hurry up.

377
00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:41.190
Are you done?

378
00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:42.870
Yes.

379
00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:54.700
Forgive me for my rudeness.

380
00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:57.150
I have

381
00:19:57.150 --> 00:19:58.020
delivered the jade whistle

382
00:19:58.020 --> 00:19:59.260
to Princess Hua for you.

383
00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:01.540
Princess Hua is a kind lady.

384
00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:02.980
She will definitely help you

385
00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:04.740
pass it to His Highness.

386
00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:08.220
Thank you, Lady Du.

387
00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:11.670
I don't know if

388
00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:13.140
I've interrupted your life

389
00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:14.140
in the last few days.

390
00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:17.830
Indeed.

391
00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:21.500
However,

392
00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:24.110
I don't usually go out either.

393
00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:26.870
My grandfather has
recently caught a cold

394
00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:28.110
and is unwell.

395
00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:29.940
So most of the servants

396
00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:31.390
are taking care of him.

397
00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:33.430
Don't worry.

398
00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:35.260
Once I've recovered,

399
00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:36.260
I'll leave here

400
00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:37.620
as soon as I can.

401
00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:38.670
I...

402
00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:41.700
I didn't mean to drive you away.

403
00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:43.870
I just...

404
00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:44.980
I get it.

405
00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:46.390
Thank you

406
00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:48.190
for saving my life this time.

407
00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:50.020
Actually,

408
00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:52.870
His Highness and I...

409
00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:54.460
No need to explain.

410
00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:56.780
Since it's your secret,

411
00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:58.220
you don't have to tell me.

412
00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:03.870
I...

413
00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:06.220
I'll go and boil the herbs.

414
00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:08.220
Take a good rest.

415
00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:30.740
(Qunying Eatery)

416
00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:33.390
Prince Ying.

417
00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:35.700
We have a lot of customers today.

418
00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:38.110
This business is booming.

419
00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:39.220
Maybe today

420
00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:40.980
we can turn a loss into a profit.

421
00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:45.670
Did Princess Jiamin come today?

422
00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:49.590
No, she didn't.

423
00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:03.980
(Qunying Eatery)

424
00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:04.950
Prince Ying.

425
00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:05.700
You must remember

426
00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:07.020
why you ran for the post of

427
00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:07.830
Ceremonial Officer.

428
00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:09.700
If you give in now,

429
00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:10.590
that means you are

430
00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:11.740
surrendering everything.

431
00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:13.390
Prince Ying.

432
00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:14.670
Let's open a shop.

433
00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:18.060
Sure.

434
00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:19.350
What do you think

435
00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:20.300
of the name?

436
00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:23.300
(Qunying Eatery)

437
00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:25.830
Yangcao Eatery?

438
00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:29.540
It's a grand name.

439
00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:32.590
It is brilliant and perfect.

440
00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:33.830
Princess Jiamin.

441
00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:38.220
It is called Qunying Eatery.

442
00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:57.740
Greetings, Prince Ying.

443
00:22:58.500 --> 00:22:59.460
Princess Hua.

444
00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:05.460
Have you seen Princess Jiamin recently?

445
00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:08.150
I did see her

446
00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:09.020
recently,

447
00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:11.430
but she didn't

448
00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:12.870
seem happy.

449
00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:15.430
Yuan Wei.

450
00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:24.060
Princess Hua.

451
00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:26.980
I know you have always admired me,

452
00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:28.430
but

453
00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:31.390
I may not be able to accept it.

454
00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:33.190
Before, I thought that

455
00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:35.060
if father granted me a marriage,

456
00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:36.350
I would just accept it,

457
00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:38.460
but now

458
00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:40.220
I seem to have

459
00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:41.350
second thoughts.

460
00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:43.100
So you should

461
00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:44.300
keep this.

462
00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:47.220
Although this doll

463
00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:48.620
looks a bit like me,

464
00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:51.060
which shows how much you like me,

465
00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:52.700
but

466
00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:55.150
I will have to let you down.

467
00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:57.350
Prince Ying.

468
00:23:58.220 --> 00:23:59.260
I never said

469
00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:00.740
this doll is for you.

470
00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:03.700
I just heard that

471
00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:04.700
Jiamin

472
00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:06.660
fancies this little thing.

473
00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:10.500
So Jiamin likes this.

474
00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:14.060
What does it have to do with me?

475
00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:15.180
Since she likes it,

476
00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:16.660
you should give it to her.

477
00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:17.540
Even I get it.

478
00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:18.820
Do we have to make it so clear?

479
00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:24.390
Thank you, Princess Hua.

480
00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:25.060
Prince Ying.

481
00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:26.300
Don't be so courteous.

482
00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:28.060
We owe you a big thank you

483
00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:29.460
for supporting our business.

484
00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:30.540
Also,

485
00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:31.780
it's our pleasure

486
00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:33.020
that you like our pottery dolls

487
00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:34.870
so much.

488
00:24:37.670 --> 00:24:39.260
Just say you got it for her,

489
00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:40.630
not our Princess.

490
00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:43.740
Why?

491
00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:46.590
Just do it.

492
00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:51.700
Thank you, Princess Hua.

493
00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:56.700
That's how you use a love token.

494
00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:07.430
Princess, eat something.

495
00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:09.380
(Serenity)

496
00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:11.220
I have no appetite.

497
00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:13.020
Princess.

498
00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:14.220
Are you sure

499
00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:15.700
you don't want to meet Prince Ying?

500
00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:17.350
What's the point?

501
00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:18.220
He does nothing

502
00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:19.300
but to piss me off.

503
00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:21.500
I was told that Prince Ying

504
00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:23.340
was standing outside for a long time.

505
00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:28.780
Then tell him I'm busy

506
00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:29.910
and ask him to leave.

507
00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:32.740
Yes.

508
00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:08.900
(Grand Preceptor Mansion)

509
00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:23.740
(It's His Highness.)

510
00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:26.060
(Looks like he got the jade whistle.)

511
00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:20.590
Your Highness.

512
00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:24.390
Please rise.

513
00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:27.780
Your Highness.

514
00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:28.780
You don't really

515
00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:29.870
have to come here yourself.

516
00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:31.540
No.

517
00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:33.110
As I said before,

518
00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:35.630
wherever you go,

519
00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:37.700
I will try to find you.

520
00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:39.870
I must keep

521
00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:40.830
my promise.

522
00:27:59.630 --> 00:28:00.460
Young Master Yun.

523
00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:02.740
Young Master Yun.

524
00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:06.870
Young Master Yun.

525
00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:14.830
(He left without saying goodbye.)

526
00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:37.000
(Han)

527
00:28:37.670 --> 00:28:40.630
(I will make up for your dowry.)

528
00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:00.980
Looks like you've met the right person.

529
00:29:01.630 --> 00:29:02.830
When you were in danger,

530
00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:05.540
this person gave you ginseng soup

531
00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:07.300
and treated the wound in time.

532
00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:09.110
Otherwise,

533
00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:11.300
you would have contracted a disease.

534
00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:14.700
Your Highness.

535
00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:17.350
He is now recovering

536
00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:19.110
and just needs to recuperate.

537
00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:20.910
I have given him

538
00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:22.780
some prescriptions to nourish his body.

539
00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:24.300
Qi, Ba.

540
00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:25.740
See Physician Qiu off.

541
00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:26.300
- Yes.
- Yes.

542
00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:27.260
Thank you, Your Highness.

543
00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:29.060
This way, Physician Qiu.

544
00:29:39.390 --> 00:29:40.020
Your Highness.

545
00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:41.630
Lady Du saved me.

546
00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:43.820
Why was it

547
00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:45.980
Lady Du who saved you?

548
00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:48.590
I was lucky

549
00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:50.540
to run into her by chance.

550
00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:52.630
The information I received
that day was false.

551
00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:54.460
The second prince of Jinpo

552
00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:55.830
is currently in the capital.

553
00:29:57.260 --> 00:29:57.740
Why?

554
00:29:58.460 --> 00:29:59.740
Have you already known?

555
00:30:02.150 --> 00:30:03.060
Since He Yuanting

556
00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:04.670
is already in the capital,

557
00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:06.980
I'll keep an eye on him as planned.

558
00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:11.190
You did very well.

559
00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:12.980
Take a good rest.

560
00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:26.100
(Minister Mansion)

561
00:30:38.150 --> 00:30:38.580
Princess.

562
00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:40.260
Why aren't we going in?

563
00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:41.620
We'll go in

564
00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:42.380
when Prince Ying has left.

565
00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:43.820
What if he won't leave?

566
00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:44.900
He waited outside

567
00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:45.980
all day last time.

568
00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:47.150
Your parents

569
00:30:47.150 --> 00:30:49.060
came out to greet him in person.

570
00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:50.950
Since you refused to see him,

571
00:30:51.150 --> 00:30:53.390
your mother persuaded him to leave.

572
00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:56.430
I didn't expect him to come again today.

573
00:30:58.950 --> 00:30:59.620
He told me

574
00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:00.980
that he had been
very stubborn since young.

575
00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:02.280
He probably won't leave

576
00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:03.280
until he sees me.

577
00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:04.120
Come here.

578
00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:04.800
Listen.

579
00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:05.700
We can't go that way.

580
00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:06.760
We have to climb up.

581
00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:07.680
What?

582
00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:08.830
Just do it.

583
00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:10.540
Come on, help me.

584
00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:14.540
Be careful.

585
00:31:18.670 --> 00:31:19.670
It's a little high.

586
00:31:19.870 --> 00:31:20.590
Hong.

587
00:31:20.670 --> 00:31:21.830
Hong, hold me.

588
00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:23.540
Don't worry. I'm here.

589
00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:29.870
Be careful.

590
00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:35.430
I'm working out.

591
00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:38.500
I've been waiting for you here

592
00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:39.630
for a few days,

593
00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:40.460
but your parents say

594
00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:41.620
you're very busy these days.

595
00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:43.630
So,

596
00:31:43.910 --> 00:31:45.500
have you been busy lately?

597
00:31:46.670 --> 00:31:48.630
I'm indeed busy these days.

598
00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:50.020
So I can't see you.

599
00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:53.220
Then you should go back and rest.

600
00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:55.540
Your Highness.

601
00:31:55.670 --> 00:31:56.350
Prince Ying.

602
00:31:58.390 --> 00:31:59.630
Why did you come

603
00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:01.260
to see me?

604
00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:14.500
I recently found a little something

605
00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:16.020
I'd like to give you.

606
00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:17.220
I think

607
00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:18.540
you'll like it.

608
00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:23.700
This is rare.

609
00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:27.630
Do you really like it?

610
00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:28.870
Of course.

611
00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:30.390
Is this for me?

612
00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:34.940
I didn't expect you to love

613
00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:36.060
this ugly thing.

614
00:32:38.150 --> 00:32:39.630
Since it's ugly, why did you buy it?

615
00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:41.870
No.

616
00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:43.980
Why are you angry again?

617
00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:45.420
I was trying

618
00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:46.500
to make you happy.

619
00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:50.150
Are you trying to make me happy?

620
00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:54.260
Why?

621
00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:02.700
Because

622
00:33:02.910 --> 00:33:04.020
when you're not happy,

623
00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:05.700
I can't see you.

624
00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:07.910
When I can't see you,

625
00:33:08.390 --> 00:33:10.220
I'm unhappy as well.

626
00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:16.020
So

627
00:33:16.390 --> 00:33:18.500
what do you mean?

628
00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:24.910
So

629
00:33:25.630 --> 00:33:26.460
I think

630
00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:29.430
that's what it means.

631
00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:47.540
Your Highness.

632
00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:48.950
For you.

633
00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:55.350
Why are you so preoccupied?

634
00:33:58.380 --> 00:33:59.740
After ten years

635
00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:01.980
of trusting you,

636
00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:03.740
I didn't expect you

637
00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:05.630
to be someone of the enemy.

638
00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:06.780
Your Highness.

639
00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:08.180
I am not with the enemy.

640
00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:09.540
I am with you.

641
00:34:09.650 --> 00:34:10.560
I'm not talking about you.

642
00:34:10.950 --> 00:34:12.020
Of course you are,

643
00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:14.660
but he is.

644
00:34:15.830 --> 00:34:17.350
So what are you going to do?

645
00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:22.500
He did not simply betray,

646
00:34:23.350 --> 00:34:24.580
I believe

647
00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:26.580
he actually faltered.

648
00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:31.230
I think

649
00:34:31.390 --> 00:34:32.500
there is a reason

650
00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:33.540
why you chose to trust him

651
00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:35.100
ten years ago.

652
00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:36.660
Now that he's faltering,

653
00:34:36.830 --> 00:34:38.180
you should win him back

654
00:34:38.270 --> 00:34:39.310
and make him

655
00:34:39.310 --> 00:34:40.390
loyal to you completely.

656
00:34:41.910 --> 00:34:42.750
I get it.

657
00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:46.060
Thank you, Liuli.

658
00:34:47.910 --> 00:34:49.580
Why did you indict me again?

659
00:34:49.660 --> 00:34:51.500
It's just a drink.

660
00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:52.460
Why did you indict me?

661
00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:55.230
I have no one else to indict.

662
00:34:55.790 --> 00:34:57.540
You went to brothel.

663
00:34:57.910 --> 00:34:59.460
- Brothel?
- Beat him

664
00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:00.860
so I can indict you as well tomorrow.

665
00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:01.710
I...

666
00:35:01.710 --> 00:35:02.660
No violence.

667
00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:03.300
Stop fooling around.

668
00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:05.580
Prince Consort.

669
00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:06.980
Prince Consort.

670
00:35:11.710 --> 00:35:13.350
I cannot agree with

671
00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:15.710
(Prince Consort, Xie Linzhou)
what you have just said.

672
00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:17.830
We are all
Grand Preceptor Du's students.

673
00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:20.270
Do you still remember his advice?

674
00:35:20.830 --> 00:35:21.870
An official

675
00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:23.710
should take into account

676
00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:25.870
the importance of
the people and the State.

677
00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:28.140
But today you are caught up in

678
00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:30.460
your personal and trivial matter.

679
00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:32.910
What a disgrace.

680
00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:34.350
You are right.

681
00:35:34.660 --> 00:35:35.140
Yes.

682
00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:36.230
- Please forgive us.
- Yes.

683
00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:37.810
We're indebted to his teaching.

684
00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:39.220
Yes.

685
00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:41.180
I was out of line.

686
00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:44.140
I hope you all will forgive me.

687
00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:46.310
- No.
- You don't have to.

688
00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:49.390
I've just returned to the capital today

689
00:35:49.390 --> 00:35:51.540
and I'm going to report to His Majesty.

690
00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:53.520
I'll see you all next time.

691
00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:54.500
Take care, Prince Consort.

692
00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:55.640
- See you again.
- Goodbye.

693
00:36:02.210 --> 00:36:03.790
It's been a long time
since I've seen him.

694
00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:05.140
Prince Consort Xie

695
00:36:05.350 --> 00:36:07.140
is becoming more like
the Grand Preceptor.

696
00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:09.430
His term as the Governor of Jin

697
00:36:09.430 --> 00:36:10.660
has ended.

698
00:36:11.020 --> 00:36:12.660
He is returning to report on his duties.

699
00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:14.430
I wonder if he will

700
00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:16.580
stay in the capital.

701
00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:30.060
Prince.

702
00:36:30.270 --> 00:36:31.620
Qing Yue is dead.

703
00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:33.600
I think the Crown Prince

704
00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:34.540
sent someone to kill him.

705
00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:35.780
I didn't expect them

706
00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:36.830
to discover the trail so quickly.

707
00:36:38.710 --> 00:36:40.350
We have to move again.

708
00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:46.230
Grandfather.

709
00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:49.390
Grandfather.

710
00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:50.750
Drink this medicine first.

711
00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:52.140
You can continue later.

712
00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:54.580
The subject of this test

713
00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:57.500
is more important than my life.

714
00:36:57.830 --> 00:36:59.140
Just put it aside.

715
00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:02.430
I'll drink after I'm done.

716
00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:08.310
Grandfather.

717
00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:11.230
Why don't you take a break?

718
00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:13.660
Let me write it for you.

719
00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:15.390
Grandfather.

720
00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:28.750
Grandfather.

721
00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:36.830
I'm old.

722
00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:42.980
I don't know if I can last

723
00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:45.870
until the envoy meeting.

724
00:37:47.710 --> 00:37:49.270
I also don't know

725
00:37:50.350 --> 00:37:56.230
if I can hold out until you get married.

726
00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:01.620
Xiuying,

727
00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:05.950
you're like me.

728
00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:11.230
I am concerned about you.

729
00:38:13.310 --> 00:38:13.910
Grandfather.

730
00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:15.750
Grandfather.

731
00:38:17.310 --> 00:38:17.950
Grand Preceptor.

732
00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:19.660
Grand Preceptor.

733
00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:21.580
Prince Consort Xie
is back in the capital.

734
00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:23.060
He's here to see you.

735
00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:25.310
Grandfather.

736
00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:26.980
Master.

737
00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:33.460
I'm sorry

738
00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:35.580
I couldn't visit you earlier.

739
00:38:35.950 --> 00:38:36.390
Here.

740
00:38:36.870 --> 00:38:37.980
Slowly.

741
00:38:38.430 --> 00:38:39.020
Slowly.

742
00:38:43.870 --> 00:38:46.180
You were busy in Jin Ridge.

743
00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:47.900
It's not like

744
00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:49.660
you didn't visit me on purpose.

745
00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:50.460
Please rise.

746
00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:52.620
How are you doing?

747
00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:54.580
I'm glad to see you.

748
00:38:57.020 --> 00:38:57.910
Grandfather.

749
00:38:58.020 --> 00:39:00.140
(Blossoming Flowers)

750
00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:01.270
Who sent so many

751
00:39:01.350 --> 00:39:03.060
foolish books?

752
00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:04.980
They were from Princess Jiamin.

753
00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:06.870
She also told me

754
00:39:06.910 --> 00:39:08.430
to make sure you read them.

755
00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:10.540
If you can't stand it,

756
00:39:10.910 --> 00:39:12.540
I can tell you about it.

757
00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:13.870
Then all the more
reason for me to refuse.

758
00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:15.300
Miss.

759
00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:15.740
I know

760
00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:16.940
you love reading story books.

761
00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:18.020
Come on, read it.

762
00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:24.100
Blossoming Flowers.

763
00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:26.750
What is this about?

764
00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:28.430
Blossoming Flowers...

765
00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:29.790
The book is about

766
00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:31.540
a princess consort who dies of illness.

767
00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:32.790
The prince marries her little sister

768
00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:34.430
because she has a resemblance

769
00:39:34.430 --> 00:39:35.500
to her.

770
00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:36.660
Yes.

771
00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:41.430
Flowers in the Shadow.

772
00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:44.430
This book is about

773
00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:45.500
a scholar

774
00:39:45.710 --> 00:39:46.660
who made a demon

775
00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:48.180
take the form of his dead wife

776
00:39:49.390 --> 00:39:50.710
to repay his kindness.

777
00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:52.540
Jiamin.

778
00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:54.310
What is she trying to convey?

779
00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:56.350
She's trying to say...

780
00:39:56.430 --> 00:39:57.790
What she's trying to say is that

781
00:39:57.870 --> 00:39:59.750
everyone in the capital knows

782
00:39:59.750 --> 00:40:00.500
that the second daughter

783
00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:01.300
of Princess Le Yang

784
00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:02.420
is coming to the capital.

785
00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:03.700
So be careful

786
00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:05.140
not to be taken as a substitute.

787
00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:06.700
So ridiculous.

788
00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:07.310
Let's go.

789
00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:09.060
Let's ask around.

790
00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:11.390
Take care, Miss.

791
00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:17.750
What?

792
00:40:17.870 --> 00:40:19.390
I've got news for you.

793
00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:19.980
You must

794
00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:21.580
never tell anyone.

795
00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:22.230
Tell me.

796
00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:23.390
I'm a very tight-lipped person.

797
00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:24.860
Princess Le Yang

798
00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:26.100
is coming to the capital

799
00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:27.380
with her second daughter, Xie Yao.

800
00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:28.100
What?

801
00:40:29.790 --> 00:40:31.020
The envoy meeting is
about to take place.

802
00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:32.430
They are coming to see it.

803
00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:33.700
That's not it.

804
00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:34.660
They are coming here this time

805
00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:37.580
to marry Xie Yao to the Crown Prince.

806
00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:40.980
Princess Hua, listen.

807
00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:41.580
What?

808
00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:43.540
Xie Yao is going to
marry the Crown Prince.

809
00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:44.900
Princess Le Yang and
Prince Consort Xie's

810
00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:45.340
eldest daughter

811
00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:46.380
was a well-educated

812
00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:47.340
and virtuous lady.

813
00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:48.390
It's a pity that she died so young,

814
00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:49.460
but their second
daughter isn't bad either.

815
00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:50.660
- Yes.
- If she were to marry His Highness,

816
00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:51.340
wouldn't it be...

817
00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:53.820
a shame?

818
00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:56.710
(Xie Yao.)

819
00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:58.750
Who is she to steal
His Highness from me?

820
00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:01.100
Why?

821
00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:03.620
- His Highness is so popular.
- His Highness is so popular.

822
00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:06.580
(Pretentious Hour)

823
00:41:11.910 --> 00:41:12.660
Prince.

824
00:41:13.790 --> 00:41:14.300
What do you think?

825
00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:15.580
It's a nice place, isn't it?

826
00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:17.270
Come here.

827
00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:19.340
Closer.

828
00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:21.300
A little closer.

829
00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:23.060
Can't you

830
00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:24.100
find somewhere better?

831
00:41:25.950 --> 00:41:26.660
Prince.

832
00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:29.310
We have searched many places.

833
00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:31.500
If we don't want to be discovered,

834
00:41:31.830 --> 00:41:33.060
we need to keep a low profile.

835
00:41:33.580 --> 00:41:35.950
If God wants to give a man a great task,

836
00:41:35.950 --> 00:41:37.660
he must first suffer his heart and mind

837
00:41:37.660 --> 00:41:38.870
and work his muscles and bones.

838
00:41:38.910 --> 00:41:40.710
I, Jiang Sha, can accept this place.

839
00:41:41.710 --> 00:41:42.460
Great.

840
00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:43.390
Then stay here.

841
00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:44.380
On second thoughts,

842
00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:44.940
I can't.

843
00:41:53.980 --> 00:41:55.430
I can't count on others.

844
00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:58.100
I have to do it myself.
