(Righteous Radiance)

18
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.920
Your Highness.

19
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.400
Your Highness.

20
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.010
I've got all those

21
00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.450
stupid assassins of Jinpo surrounded

22
00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:58.450
and locked up in one place.

23
00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.120
Now...

24
00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.920
(Don't care about)

25
00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.730
(the stupid things he did.)

26
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:03.680
Everyone knows

27
00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.760
he's honest.

28
00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.330
I think

29
00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:11.970
when he gets married one day,

30
00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:13.970
he'll surely

31
00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.160
treasure his wife.

32
00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.930
Your Highness.

33
00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.330
Your Highness.

34
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.840
Your Highness.

35
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.680
Who did you call stupid?

36
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.210
The assassins.

37
00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.490
Do you think they could be
assassins if they were stupid?

38
00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:38.840
If they were stupid,

39
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.680
then why were we having

40
00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:40.930
such a hard time catching them?

41
00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.330
We ended up using

42
00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.650
some kind of big bait

43
00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.490
to catch these little thieves.

44
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:46.880
Do you think they are stupid?

45
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.810
No.

46
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:48.770
They are not.

47
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:49.930
Why not?

48
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.770
They're not stupid enough
to be caught by us.

49
00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:54.160
I'm stupid.

50
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.370
I'm stupid, okay?

51
00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.160
What's wrong with you today?

52
00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:58.810
You're losing your temper.

53
00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.250
Who are you talking about?

54
00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:01.400
Did I lose my temper?

55
00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:02.840
Am I short tempered?

56
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:04.090
No.

57
00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.840
Stand there.

58
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.160
Yes.

59
00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.400
Stand on one leg.

60
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.090
Spread your arms out.

61
00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:14.160
Stand still.

62
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:15.530
Hold this.

63
00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:17.120
Listen.

64
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.000
Today,

65
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.250
if it

66
00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.560
doesn't catch a fish,

67
00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:22.250
you'll keep standing here.

68
00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.770
What?

69
00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.930
Stand still.

70
00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:24.490
It...

71
00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.490
Don't move.

72
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:29.770
How is it possible to catch fish?

73
00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:30.280
Wait.

74
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.810
Your Highness.

75
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.370
This...

76
00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.000
Your Highness.

77
00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.720
Hong.

78
00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:43.280
Take a break

79
00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.280
and have a snack.

80
00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.120
Hong.

81
00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.370
Are you

82
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.770
very close to

83
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:01.650
Princess Hua lately?

84
00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.930
Hong.

85
00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:14.000
Our family is not well established.

86
00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:15.970
You don't have to worry about

87
00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.040
the Hua family's
superiority like others do.

88
00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:19.690
Listen.

89
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:21.840
Don't worry about me.

90
00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.040
You can hang out with her
whenever you want.

91
00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.970
Your Highness, do you

92
00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:40.600
want to go for a walk

93
00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:41.800
with me today?

94
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:43.400
Go for a walk?

95
00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:46.840
Indeed.

96
00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.720
I think

97
00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.570
I have not been out for many days.

98
00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.160
Exactly.

99
00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:53.280
The weather outside

100
00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.280
has been so nice.

101
00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.690
And I'd like

102
00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.840
to show the others

103
00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:59.360
the dress you gave me.

104
00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:02.840
Her mind

105
00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:04.650
is written all over her face.

106
00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.010
I think I look good in it.

107
00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.840
So what's wrong with

108
00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.010
showing it to others?

109
00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.890
You're such a sweet talker.

110
00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.770
Let's go.

111
00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:15.280
Let's go.

112
00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.400
The weather is still chilly
in the early spring.

113
00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.530
You should wear more.

114
00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.480
Thank you for your concern.

115
00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.840
Do you know why

116
00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.240
I want to set you up with Prince Ying?

117
00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:32.650
Also,

118
00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.800
I hope you don't mind that

119
00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.330
he wants to compete for the post.

120
00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:37.770
Your Highness.

121
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:39.840
I don't mind at all.

122
00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:40.840
I don't

123
00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.130
take things personally.

124
00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.330
Why do you speak so politely

125
00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.770
when it comes to serious matters?

126
00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:51.360
You have

127
00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.130
read my mind.

128
00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:54.800
I don't even know

129
00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:56.240
what to say anymore.

130
00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:59.210
All right.

131
00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.130
I'm a little tired.

132
00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.010
You guys go on over there.

133
00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.480
Remember to dine with me at noon.

134
00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:07.130
Yes, Your Highness.

135
00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:09.720
Let's go.

136
00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.160
The weather is really nice today.

137
00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:16.280
Later...

138
00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:20.210
Greetings, Consort Xian.

139
00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:21.530
Consort Shu.

140
00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.480
You're quite interesting.

141
00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:25.690
People who don't know

142
00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.360
would think you are a harem.

143
00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.280
Did you come to this garden

144
00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.600
all dolled up

145
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.360
to have an encounter with His Majesty?

146
00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.090
Indeed.

147
00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.330
This is

148
00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:37.210
not uncommon amongst others.

149
00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:41.890
I'm reminding Princess Hua.

150
00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.450
Who are you mocking?

151
00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:48.210
You got me wrong.

152
00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:50.570
It's a beautiful day.

153
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:51.130
So I...

154
00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:52.840
Consort Xian, do you mean that

155
00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.570
Princess Hua came here

156
00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:57.400
to provoke His Majesty?

157
00:06:58.130 --> 00:06:59.530
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

158
00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.720
Princess Hua is my guest

159
00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.330
in Shoukang Palace.

160
00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:06.650
She can go

161
00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:07.970
wherever she wants.

162
00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.160
I didn't know

163
00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.330
there is

164
00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:14.160
a place she can't go.

165
00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.530
Please forgive me.

166
00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:20.130
It seems

167
00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.040
I need to remind His Majesty

168
00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.450
not to be so occupied
with national affairs

169
00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:26.920
that he neglects
the management of his harem.

170
00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:29.210
You may leave.

171
00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:30.970
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Yes, Your Highness.

172
00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:38.800
Your Highness.

173
00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.090
Don't mind

174
00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:42.400
what they say.

175
00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:45.330
Thank you, Your Highness.

176
00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:47.090
Greetings, grandmother.

177
00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:51.450
What did you come to see me for?

178
00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:55.800
I would like to

179
00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:57.360
speak to you alone.

180
00:07:57.690 --> 00:07:59.280
You've confused me.

181
00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:01.160
Whose grandma are you exactly?

182
00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.970
I'm just

183
00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:08.800
looking after Princess Hua for you.

184
00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:10.770
What's wrong with that?

185
00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.450
Grandson didn't look at you

186
00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:14.160
I see you appear to be fond of her.

187
00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.330
So I'm just curious.

188
00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:16.400
You have always...

189
00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:18.660
(The snow in the shade
is still so thick.)

190
00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:21.380
I can't relate to Princess Hua.

191
00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.360
(This is the only place
where footprints can be left.)

192
00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:24.770
Do you not relate

193
00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:26.720
or deliberately refuse
to understand her?

194
00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:30.450
I don't really understand.

195
00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:35.000
It is not easy to please people.

196
00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:38.050
And whether or not

197
00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.640
you intend to please them,

198
00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:42.450
you will know their true heart

199
00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:45.000
when you see the clarity in their eyes.

200
00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:47.480
Some unintentional acts

201
00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:50.210
can reveal their sincerity.

202
00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:53.090
Children are innocent.

203
00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:56.880
They need company all the time.

204
00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:59.000
To me, they are like

205
00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.360
a diamond in the rough,

206
00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.480
totally impeccable.

207
00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:05.810
Did you come to me

208
00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:08.570
to talk about Princess Hua?

209
00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:11.840
You have a good eye.

210
00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:15.000
I've had

211
00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:16.720
some misunderstanding
with Princess Hua.

212
00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:18.170
So I'd like to take this opportunity

213
00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:19.930
to make up with her.

214
00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:21.410
I think

215
00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:24.760
you have other intentions.

216
00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.120
Princess Hua.

217
00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:32.970
I'm hosting a banquet
in the Eastern Palace.

218
00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:34.570
Would you like to join?

219
00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:36.930
I am not in good health.

220
00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:39.170
I don't want to spoil the fun.

221
00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:44.290
There will be a barbecue.

222
00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:47.210
Your Highness.

223
00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:48.600
I guess His Highness

224
00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:49.720
wants to talk to me

225
00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.170
about the case.

226
00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:54.970
As you wish.

227
00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:56.640
Duan Jin.

228
00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:57.120
Yes.

229
00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:01.410
Thank you, grandmother.

230
00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:14.480
Your Highness.

231
00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:15.810
(Righteous Radiance)

232
00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:16.450
Why do you

233
00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:17.930
have a persimmon tree here?

234
00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:20.810
This persimmon tree

235
00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.170
was planted

236
00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:23.290
when I was little.

237
00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:26.090
I was very young at the time

238
00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:27.210
and had to hide in the house

239
00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:28.930
in thick clothes

240
00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:29.930
because I was sick.

241
00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:31.720
Mother noticed I was bored.

242
00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:32.760
So she asked the servants

243
00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:33.930
to bring in some large pots

244
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.090
and plant trees with me

245
00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:37.640
soon after they were
moved to the courtyard,

246
00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:40.330
all the other trees died,

247
00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:42.600
except this persimmon tree,

248
00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:44.810
which survived.

249
00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:49.840
After that,

250
00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:52.480
I was left alone

251
00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:55.840
in the whole palace.

252
00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:02.330
(I remember.)

253
00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:04.720
(Liuli.)

254
00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:06.880
(When mother died,)

255
00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:08.720
(Righteous Radiance)
(I was so upset)

256
00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:11.000
(that I forgot to write back to Liuli.)

257
00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:13.360
(From now on,)

258
00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:14.480
(I am)

259
00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:16.170
(a motherless child.)

260
00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:24.970
Your Highness.

261
00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:27.210
This tree is so meaningful.

262
00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:29.600
You will have the best of everything

263
00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:31.120
for the rest of your life.

264
00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:53.210
What kind of chess is that?

265
00:11:58.570 --> 00:11:59.600
Cat chess.

266
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000
Do you know how to play it?

267
00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:03.840
I'll teach you.

268
00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:04.970
Sure.

269
00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:09.210
How do you play it?

270
00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:11.810
Move the pieces diagonally.

271
00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:13.810
Whoever goes to the end line first wins.

272
00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:14.640
I see.

273
00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:47.810
Your Highness.

274
00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:49.170
It's your turn.

275
00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:53.000
It's getting late.

276
00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:54.090
It's time to eat.

277
00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:55.570
Please join me.

278
00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:57.840
Serve the dishes.

279
00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:03.450
Your Highness, everything is served.

280
00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:07.720
I've heard that soldiers

281
00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:08.970
like to barbecue.

282
00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:11.170
I thought you might like it.

283
00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:13.000
Yes, I like it.

284
00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:14.640
I'll roast them for you.

285
00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:19.140

Your Highness.

288
00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:27.720
You need to

289
00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:29.930
roast the meat on the fire.

290
00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:32.700
♪Your face is like a painting♪

♪It's engraved in my heart♪

293
00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:39.520
You have to grease it as you roast it.

Remember to flip it over.

295
00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:43.170
I see.

What else would you like to eat?

299
00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:50.090
I'll roast it for you.

300
00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:52.330
I like winter melon.

301
00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:53.640
Roasted winter melon

302
00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:55.330
will turn transparent.

303
00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:56.760
Sprinkle with pepper

304
00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:58.290
and it will taste delicious.

305
00:13:58.570 --> 00:14:00.090
Winter melon?

♪I've had you in my

roast them for you today?

312
00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:11.290
You should just enjoy it.

313
00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:14.090
Would you like to eat pig intestines?

314
00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:16.760
Meatballs?

315
00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:30.690
You are good at it.

316
00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:32.970
However,

317
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.330
the last time I went to your place

318
00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:35.600
with my brother,

319
00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:38.210
why were we only served pancakes

320
00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:39.210
and soup noodles?

321
00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:40.810
That's because that was

322
00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:42.880
all the food I had.

323
00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:44.290
I haven't even

324
00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:46.090
grown any greens yet.

325
00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:49.050
Although the Hua family
has gone to the border,

326
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:50.690
a young lady like you

327
00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:52.520
shouldn't be staying

328
00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:54.690
in the barracks all the time.

329
00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:57.000
I didn't usually go there,

330
00:14:57.050 --> 00:14:58.360
but sometimes

331
00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:00.690
when my parents and
brother were away at war

332
00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:02.170
I was the only member

333
00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:03.290
of the Hua family in town.

334
00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:05.760
I may be weak

335
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.240
and not able to help much,

336
00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:08.360
but

337
00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:09.640
I need to be there for the soldiers

338
00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:10.570
and the people

339
00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:12.690
so they will know

340
00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:14.330
that whether they win or lose,

341
00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:15.410
Hua family

342
00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:16.880
will always be with them.

343
00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:24.120
Why are you hesitant

344
00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:26.720
to make your move?

345
00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:28.050
I'm being cautious.

346
00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:33.520
Worship day

347
00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:36.520
is in a few days, right?

348
00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:37.690
Yes.

349
00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:39.930
I'll need you to

350
00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:41.120
come with me then.

351
00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:43.450
I think

352
00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:45.640
we should let Hua Liuli

353
00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:47.290
go with us.

354
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.690
The Hua family has been
loyal for generations.

355
00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:51.970
As the only daughter of the Hua family

356
00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:53.880
and the only member left

357
00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:56.760
in Yujing at present,

358
00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:59.000
there is no reason why
she should not go.

359
00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:02.880
It's not that she can't go,

360
00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:05.210
it's just that some time ago,

361
00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:07.210
you advised me

362
00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:09.450
to be discreet

363
00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:11.520
and not to let such

364
00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:13.450
a frail lady like Hua Liuli

365
00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:15.330
take part in national affairs.

366
00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:19.090
You must have misremembered.

367
00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:22.600
Why would I say such a thing?

368
00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:24.000
Mother.

369
00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:25.970
Didn't you...

370
00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:28.570
I don't know anything

371
00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:30.520
about national affairs.

372
00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:34.690
I just hope that Hua Liuli

373
00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:35.880
and Yuanhao

374
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.360
can spend more time together

375
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.480
and get to know each other better

376
00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:41.520
so that

377
00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:43.690
they can bond more.

378
00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:46.930
That's true.

379
00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:49.050
I'm glad that the Hua family

380
00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:50.000
and the royal family

381
00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:52.360
have ties.

382
00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:06.720
Mother, you're playing very well.

383
00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:09.520
I'm sure I'll lose.

384
00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:23.560
Your Highness.

385
00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:27.930
Am I too gluttonous?

386
00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:31.240
You don't have to be shy

387
00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:32.850
in front of me.

388
00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:34.560
By the way, Princess Hua,

389
00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:38.890
I have some gifts

390
00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:39.890
I would like to show you.

391
00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:44.320
Princess Hua.

392
00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:45.650
Look.

393
00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:49.450
These are the gifts
you gave me back then.

394
00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:52.480
I have all these items

395
00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:53.690
displayed in

396
00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:54.410
my treasure rack.

397
00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:56.480
(To Crown Prince)
And these letters.

398
00:17:56.850 --> 00:17:58.240
I stored them in a box.

399
00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:00.410
This is the diarrhea
tablet you mentioned.

400
00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:01.560
I did suffer from diarrhea a lot

401
00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:03.130
once I accidentally opened it.

402
00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:05.240
And this.

403
00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:08.930
You said it's called
Snow Crisp Mountain.

404
00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:10.690
But when I got it,

405
00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:11.520
I searched everywhere

406
00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:12.760
and couldn't find the mountain,

407
00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.320
but a box.

408
00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:15.610
This Snow Crisp Mountain

409
00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.370
must have melted on the way here.

410
00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:18.410
Melted?

411
00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:19.850
I'll make you another one

412
00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:21.320
when I get a chance.

413
00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:31.240
Your Highness.

414
00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:32.930
I can't believe

415
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.450
you've kept these

416
00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:36.240
worthless items until now.

417
00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:37.760
I find them interesting.

418
00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:40.210
You also made

419
00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:41.370
a heart-shaped spiked ball.

420
00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:42.760
So cute.

421
00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:45.320
Do you really find it cute?

422
00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:47.320
Cute and creative.

423
00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:48.130
I can tell

424
00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:49.720
the person who made this

425
00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:51.040
had a lot of thought put into it.

426
00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:52.340
When I received

427
00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:53.370
this spiked ball,

428
00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:54.080
I couldn't find

429
00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:55.320
where the letter was,

430
00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:57.210
but when I opened it,

431
00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:02.720
it was in this heart.

432
00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:05.370
At that time, I thought

433
00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:08.080
that this heart

434
00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:10.410
might represent

435
00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:12.800
the owner's heart.

436
00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:15.800
I gave it to you

437
00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:17.240
because I thought it was

438
00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:19.000
the best way to show my feelings.

439
00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:22.480
So

440
00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:23.890
did you

441
00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:27.130
find these things yourself

442
00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:28.280
or did you make them yourself?

443
00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:29.890
Of course I made them myself.

444
00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:31.000
Does it mean that

445
00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:32.320
you put your heart and soul

446
00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:33.820
into designing these

447
00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:35.100
at that time

448
00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:37.820
and sent them all the way to me?

449
00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:46.220
Unfortunately, you never

450
00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:47.660
sent anything to me

451
00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:48.500
after that.

452
00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:52.650
The border was hectic with war.

453
00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:55.450
Unexpected events happened all the time.

454
00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:57.080
I

455
00:19:57.410 --> 00:19:59.040
didn't mean not to send it.

456
00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:01.130
I really miss

457
00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:03.040
Liuli who

458
00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:04.410
sent me her heart

459
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.480
in a spiked ball.

460
00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:10.690
I also miss

461
00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:12.320
the simple and kind

462
00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:13.970
Crown Prince

463
00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:15.450
who spoke his mind.

464
00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:37.850
Make haste.

465
00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:39.450
Today is worship day.

466
00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:40.520
If anything goes wrong,

467
00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:41.560
you'll bear the consequences.

468
00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:42.610
Understand?

469
00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:43.280
Yes.

470
00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:44.610
You two, go this way.

471
00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:45.170
Yes.

472
00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:46.850
You two, go over there.

473
00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:47.410
Yes.

474
00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:48.280
The rest of you come with me.

475
00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:48.890
Hurry up.

476
00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:52.650
The Empress Dowager said

477
00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:54.210
that you will go out on behalf of

478
00:20:54.210 --> 00:20:54.970
Shoukang Palace.

479
00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:56.130
You are

480
00:20:56.210 --> 00:20:57.890
representing Shoukang Palace.

481
00:20:58.800 --> 00:20:59.760
Her Highness

482
00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:01.650
has chosen your gown for you.

483
00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:13.320
I am grateful.

484
00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:16.930
It will be very inconvenient
to get changed

485
00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:18.720
after the ceremony starts today.

486
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:19.720
So you must

487
00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:21.130
drink less water.

488
00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:24.650
I will bear it in mind.

489
00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:26.760
Her Highness also said that

490
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.480
although it is a worship ceremony,

491
00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:30.850
you are still weak

492
00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:32.130
and must be taken care of.

493
00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:36.450
Please take these

494
00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:37.890
in case you need them.

495
00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:45.690
I appreciate it.

496
00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:44.450
Princess Hua.

497
00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:50.690
How are you getting on?

498
00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:52.720
Your Highness.

499
00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:53.890
Why are you so

500
00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:55.170
poorly dressed today?

501
00:22:56.930 --> 00:22:57.410
Am I?

502
00:22:58.480 --> 00:22:59.370
Use this hand warmer.

503
00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:06.890
I'll get going.

504
00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:15.480
Hua Liuli.

505
00:23:19.930 --> 00:23:20.650
How come

506
00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:22.080
I see you everywhere?

507
00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:24.080
Greetings, Your Highness.

508
00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:26.210
It is fate that we always meet.

509
00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:27.760
I really

510
00:23:27.850 --> 00:23:28.850
don't want to see you at all.

511
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.240
That can't be helped.

512
00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:31.130
We may

513
00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:33.080
have to see each other
a lot in the future.

514
00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:06.000
First bow.

515
00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:13.210
Second bow.

516
00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:20.320
Third bow.

517
00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:27.970
The ceremony is over.

518
00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:32.170
His Highness will read the tribute.

519
00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:36.280
In the 30th year of prosperity,

520
00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:39.240
I dared to proclaim to
the Heaven, to my ancestors,

521
00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:42.280
and to the Emperor,
that I shall uphold the rules

522
00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:44.970
and that the people shall be
the foundation of the state,

523
00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:46.450
thus strengthening the nation.

524
00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:49.450
Princess Jiamin.

525
00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:51.690
His Highness looks quite serious

526
00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:52.850
when it comes to state affairs.

527
00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:56.520
It is evident to all.

528
00:24:57.610 --> 00:24:59.130
Do you think

529
00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:00.690
it should be Prince Ying

530
00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:02.760
who reads the tribute?

531
00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:03.320
Can you be quiet?

532
00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:05.520
(All living beings deserve their place)

533
00:25:05.850 --> 00:25:08.320
(now and in the past.)

534
00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:09.610
(I hereby)

535
00:25:09.690 --> 00:25:11.040
offer my respects to Heaven,

536
00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:12.240
the God of the Earth,

537
00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:14.970
and the God of the Sky
so that the weather will be fine,

538
00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:17.450
all things will flourish,

539
00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:18.860
and there will be

540
00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:20.930
(peace and tranquillity.)

541
00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:24.320
What now?

542
00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:26.040
Would you like milk candy?

543
00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:29.130
No, thanks.

544
00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:30.170
Fine.

545
00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:32.040
(I shall carry out my duties)

546
00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:35.000
(for the sake of peace and
prosperity for all generations)

547
00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:38.080
and to do my utmost
for my land and people.

548
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:40.850
Your Majesty.

549
00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:45.720
I'd like to have a word with Prince Ying

550
00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:47.170
and Princess Hua.

551
00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:53.370
Prince Ying and Princess Hua.
Please come forward.

552
00:25:54.410 --> 00:25:55.760
Since you're going up there,

553
00:25:55.850 --> 00:25:56.690
give me the milk candy.

554
00:25:57.410 --> 00:25:57.970
No.

555
00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:15.890
The Hua family...

556
00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:18.370
His Royal Highness

557
00:26:18.450 --> 00:26:20.760
Contributed to the great
victory of the State of Jin.

558
00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:21.410
Take this milk candy.

559
00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:24.450
It is a demonstration of

560
00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:28.170
our prestige.

561
00:26:29.610 --> 00:26:31.520
His Majesty has asked you both

562
00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:33.560
to compete for the post
of Ceremonial Officer

563
00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:37.170
in the hope that you young people

564
00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:40.690
will make a name for yourselves

565
00:26:40.890 --> 00:26:42.480
and contribute your wisdom to the state.

566
00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:43.760
Princess Hua.

567
00:26:45.610 --> 00:26:46.560
Yes, Your Highness.

568
00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:48.970
His Majesty never defies

569
00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:51.690
a woman's talents.

570
00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:53.560
Your mother, General Wei,

571
00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:55.240
fought in the battlefield

572
00:26:55.450 --> 00:26:56.720
and served the state

573
00:26:57.610 --> 00:27:00.210
as a pillar of the nation.

574
00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:02.650
I hope that

575
00:27:03.170 --> 00:27:06.720
you will inherit
the valour of the Hua family

576
00:27:06.890 --> 00:27:09.320
and not disgrace its reputation.

577
00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:12.610
Can you do that?

578
00:27:16.610 --> 00:27:18.450
Yes, Your Highness.

579
00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:31.240
Greetings, Princess Hua.

580
00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:32.520
Madam Duan Jin.

581
00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:33.970
The Empress Dowager said

582
00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:35.690
you have worn these gowns.

583
00:27:35.890 --> 00:27:37.520
There's no point keeping them here.

584
00:27:37.690 --> 00:27:39.480
So please take them all back.

585
00:27:39.650 --> 00:27:40.450
Also,

586
00:27:40.650 --> 00:27:42.280
Her Highness has gathered

587
00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:43.130
some of her favourite items

588
00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:44.690
from her youth

589
00:27:44.850 --> 00:27:46.450
for you to take back

590
00:27:46.610 --> 00:27:47.850
since they are no longer useful.

591
00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:49.480
She had asked me

592
00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:50.720
to make some snacks and treats

593
00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:52.560
early in the morning.

594
00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:53.690
She said

595
00:27:54.130 --> 00:27:56.040
you would

596
00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:57.480
enjoy them.

597
00:27:57.690 --> 00:27:59.930
No one at Shoukang Palace
likes it either.

598
00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:01.800
So you can take it back.

599
00:28:02.650 --> 00:28:03.890
I've put

600
00:28:03.970 --> 00:28:05.800
everything in the carriage for you.

601
00:28:06.610 --> 00:28:08.210
Thank you, Madam Duan Jin.

602
00:28:19.890 --> 00:28:21.210
Your Highness.

603
00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:24.080
I'm going home.

604
00:28:24.850 --> 00:28:26.720
Take care of yourself.

605
00:28:26.890 --> 00:28:29.240
I will come and visit you again.

606
00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:33.480
(I wish you)

607
00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:35.480
(all the blessings.)

608
00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:39.800
It's good to see you go.

609
00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:42.320
You're so noisy.

610
00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:48.410
Your Highness.

611
00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.320
I think I've caught a cold.

612
00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:21.130
Miss.

613
00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:27.480
Third prince.

614
00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:29.650
Are you waiting...

615
00:29:58.930 --> 00:29:59.890
Your Highness.

616
00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:00.720
Princess Hua.

617
00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:03.320
Are you also here to see me off?

618
00:30:06.930 --> 00:30:09.210
I want to thank you

619
00:30:09.890 --> 00:30:11.320
for taking care of me that day.

620
00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:12.720
Since that day,

621
00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:15.610
you have grown in stature

622
00:30:17.410 --> 00:30:18.320
in my mind.

623
00:30:18.930 --> 00:30:20.690
I am a grown-up.

624
00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:23.000
You're right.

625
00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:24.560
By the way,

626
00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.210
if you wish to return

627
00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:27.850
to the Hua Mansion in Jinque Street,

628
00:30:27.930 --> 00:30:29.280
I will speak to father tomorrow.

629
00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:30.320
No need.

630
00:30:30.450 --> 00:30:32.000
I'm used to living in my old house

631
00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:33.000
in the western suburbs

632
00:30:33.210 --> 00:30:34.890
and I have my own people there.

633
00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:35.760
So

634
00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:37.130
there's no safer place than there.

635
00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:38.000
You're right.

636
00:30:38.370 --> 00:30:40.040
Your place is now

637
00:30:40.410 --> 00:30:42.930
impenetrable against assassins.

638
00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:45.720
Your Highness.

639
00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:47.210
If there's nothing else,

640
00:30:47.370 --> 00:30:48.480
I'll be off.

641
00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:51.850
Your face is sweating.

642
00:30:58.410 --> 00:30:59.410
Your Highness.

643
00:30:59.690 --> 00:31:00.690
Don't get me wrong.

644
00:31:00.850 --> 00:31:02.450
I just like it fair.

645
00:31:03.690 --> 00:31:04.520
I will not judge

646
00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:05.650
your personal preferences.

647
00:31:07.690 --> 00:31:08.320
Well,

648
00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:10.800
I'll get going then.

649
00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:11.930
Thank you.

650
00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:20.540
(Ambitious)

651
00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:26.520
Big news.

652
00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:27.650
Big news.

653
00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:32.720
This is too much.

654
00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:34.760
Prince Ying is too much.

655
00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.890
This is no longer a surprise.

656
00:31:37.370 --> 00:31:39.000
When I was confined in Shoukang Palace,

657
00:31:39.170 --> 00:31:40.560
he had all the time he needed

658
00:31:40.650 --> 00:31:42.040
to make his case.

659
00:31:42.450 --> 00:31:43.480
Moreover,

660
00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:44.480
given the position of the Hua family

661
00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:46.170
in the hearts of the people,

662
00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:47.760
what harm would it do

663
00:31:47.850 --> 00:31:49.000
if he got ahead?

664
00:31:49.170 --> 00:31:50.480
Certainly not.

665
00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:53.560
See?

666
00:31:53.890 --> 00:31:55.170
Princess Hua

667
00:31:55.210 --> 00:31:57.170
is finally back after
recuperating in the palace.

668
00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:58.280
Yes.

669
00:31:58.450 --> 00:31:59.280
She was

670
00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:00.210
pampered in the palace,

671
00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:01.800
while Prince Ying was on the move

672
00:32:01.850 --> 00:32:02.410
to advocate.

673
00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:03.890
The contrast is too obvious.

674
00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:07.450
So

675
00:32:07.890 --> 00:32:09.000
who are you going to support then?

676
00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:11.370
I heard that the Hua family
will fight in a war again.

677
00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:12.610
This won't do.

678
00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:14.240
We've already won. So why start a war?

679
00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:15.800
It's better to live in peace.

680
00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:18.560
Do you hear that, Miss?

681
00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:20.650
Prince Ying also said that

682
00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:22.000
all the men who fought at the border

683
00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:23.000
should return

684
00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:24.080
and reunite with their families.

685
00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:26.480
I was actually moved by him,

686
00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:27.280
Miss.

687
00:32:27.450 --> 00:32:28.560
I can't believe that he has

688
00:32:28.650 --> 00:32:30.210
such an insight.

689
00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:35.040
All the civil officials behind him

690
00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:36.320
are in favour of bringing
down the Hua family.

691
00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:37.890
I think it's normal for him

692
00:32:37.970 --> 00:32:38.970
to act this way,

693
00:32:39.690 --> 00:32:40.970
but

694
00:32:41.890 --> 00:32:42.930
it's not clear

695
00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:44.080
whether he'll win or not.

696
00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:46.760
His Majesty will give us
the test tomorrow.

697
00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:49.480
We still have a chance.

698
00:32:50.450 --> 00:32:51.480
This is outrageous!

699
00:32:52.170 --> 00:32:54.170
I've set up a special
place to accommodate

700
00:32:54.210 --> 00:32:55.210
the envoy meeting.

701
00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:57.240
How dare you drive

702
00:32:57.410 --> 00:32:59.240
the people out so harshly?

703
00:32:59.410 --> 00:33:00.520
Do you know your mistake?

704
00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:02.930
Your Majesty, I'm wronged.

705
00:33:03.450 --> 00:33:05.690
I have told them many times

706
00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:08.000
to speak nicely to the residents

707
00:33:08.210 --> 00:33:10.480
and not to start a dispute.

708
00:33:11.170 --> 00:33:12.000
Minister Yao.

709
00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:14.210
What did you tell them?

710
00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:14.760
Why

711
00:33:14.890 --> 00:33:16.650
did this slip up?

712
00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:21.040
Your Majesty.

713
00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:23.370
I did the same as Minister Tian.

714
00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:25.170
I've made it clear to them.

715
00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:27.970
Anyone who moves out voluntarily

716
00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:30.560
is subsidised three times with silver

717
00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:32.080
and

718
00:33:32.410 --> 00:33:33.720
the subsidy policy

719
00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:35.970
is stated very clearly.

720
00:33:36.170 --> 00:33:37.690
Even farmland

721
00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:40.170
is subject to the terms of the subsidy.

722
00:33:40.210 --> 00:33:41.930
What about those who don't
want to move out voluntarily?

723
00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:44.170
It was only when I sent my watchdogs

724
00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:45.450
to investigate secretly

725
00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:48.220
that I found out your deeds.

726
00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:51.520
I have just promised my ancestors

727
00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:53.210
at the ceremony

728
00:33:53.410 --> 00:33:55.720
to be kind to people.

729
00:33:56.130 --> 00:33:56.800
You...

730
00:33:57.610 --> 00:33:59.080
Look what you've done.

731
00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:00.800
Don't you feel sorry
for your ancestors,

732
00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.040
the people

733
00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:04.000
and God?

734
00:34:04.410 --> 00:34:05.450
Your Majesty, please calm down.

735
00:34:05.610 --> 00:34:07.000
Your Majesty, please calm down.

736
00:34:07.210 --> 00:34:09.250
Your Majesty, please calm down.

737
00:34:13.330 --> 00:34:14.290
Where is Princess Hua?

738
00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:16.450
Outside the hall.

739
00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:17.120
Summon her.

740
00:34:19.290 --> 00:34:22.680
His Majesty summoned Princess Hua.

741
00:34:32.370 --> 00:34:34.520
Greetings, Your Majesty.

742
00:34:37.410 --> 00:34:38.120
Princess Hua.

743
00:34:39.410 --> 00:34:41.520
The great victory of
the state of Jin over Jinpo

744
00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:44.450
was a rare event in a century.

745
00:34:44.930 --> 00:34:47.370
The envoy meeting

746
00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:49.250
is an important event

747
00:34:49.330 --> 00:34:50.730
that reflects the prestige of our state.

748
00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:53.810
This was the reason

749
00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:56.370
for the election of
the Ceremonial Officer

750
00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:59.290
and my decision to set up a place

751
00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:01.040
to receive the envoys.

752
00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:02.640
Unfortunately,

753
00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.970
the Minister of Revenue has done

754
00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:07.680
such a ridiculous job
of relocating the people.

755
00:35:07.970 --> 00:35:10.850
So I can only appoint
Prince Ying and you

756
00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:12.810
to put this matter to rest.

757
00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:17.930
Father.

758
00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:20.680
What about the test?

759
00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:22.890
This can also be

760
00:35:23.410 --> 00:35:24.770
the test.

761
00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:25.810
Great.

762
00:35:26.250 --> 00:35:28.000
So do your best.

763
00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:30.640
Leave this matter to me.

764
00:35:30.970 --> 00:35:33.250
I will do my best.

765
00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:49.600
Prince Ying is diligent

766
00:35:49.810 --> 00:35:51.080
and righteous,

767
00:35:51.290 --> 00:35:54.160
but not as wise.

768
00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:56.480
So,

769
00:35:56.810 --> 00:35:59.730
you should help Prince Ying.

770
00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:03.000
Yes, master.

771
00:36:14.410 --> 00:36:16.560
Mother, I'm hungry.

772
00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:17.740
- Miss.
- I'm hungry.

773
00:36:17.890 --> 00:36:18.680
This is the area

774
00:36:18.810 --> 00:36:20.370
set out by His Majesty.

775
00:36:20.890 --> 00:36:22.080
It is near the north
of the Imperial City

776
00:36:22.450 --> 00:36:24.480
and bordering Jinque Street.

777
00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:26.850
It was chosen to receive
the envoys because,

778
00:36:26.930 --> 00:36:27.450
firstly,

779
00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:29.120
it can show the prestige
of our state and,

780
00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:29.730
secondly,

781
00:36:29.770 --> 00:36:31.080
it also reflects

782
00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:32.120
our liberal orientation.

783
00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:37.560
Wasn't every household

784
00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:38.600
compensated?

785
00:36:38.970 --> 00:36:40.410
How come there are so many refugees?

786
00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:43.290
There were communication problems.

787
00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:44.810
It's right next to the Imperial City,

788
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.410
which is a prime location

789
00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:47.600
for slackers.

790
00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:49.770
Even if they were given
three times the silver,

791
00:36:49.930 --> 00:36:51.520
they wouldn't move unless

792
00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:52.600
they were offered a place to go.

793
00:36:57.290 --> 00:36:59.370
Let's check it out.

794
00:36:59.450 --> 00:36:59.930
All right.

795
00:37:04.250 --> 00:37:04.850
What do you think?

796
00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:06.160
Isn't this a nice shed

797
00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:06.890
I have built?

798
00:37:09.970 --> 00:37:11.290
Not bad.

799
00:37:12.890 --> 00:37:14.370
But don't get me wrong.

800
00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:16.770
I just accept the shed,

801
00:37:16.930 --> 00:37:18.370
not you.

802
00:37:21.370 --> 00:37:23.640
I know you have ulterior motives,

803
00:37:23.850 --> 00:37:25.250
but right now

804
00:37:25.330 --> 00:37:27.520
I just want to focus on my career.

805
00:37:28.410 --> 00:37:30.080
I'm trying to take down Hua Liuli.

806
00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:32.560
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

807
00:37:32.770 --> 00:37:33.770
Princess Jiamin.

808
00:37:33.970 --> 00:37:34.930
You got it wrong.

809
00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:36.890
Hua Liuli and I

810
00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:39.000
are just opponents,

811
00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:40.120
not enemies.

812
00:37:41.810 --> 00:37:42.890
I'll have the shed torn down,

813
00:37:42.970 --> 00:37:43.520
believe it or not.

814
00:37:46.250 --> 00:37:47.410
Look at your little temper.

815
00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:48.730
However,

816
00:37:48.810 --> 00:37:50.200
it does appeal to me a bit.

817
00:37:50.410 --> 00:37:51.410
Keep it up.

818
00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:57.770
I'm going to help.

819
00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:01.730
Is this how your state

820
00:38:01.730 --> 00:38:02.970
made peace with Jinpo?

821
00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:04.680
How dare you handcuff me!

822
00:38:04.890 --> 00:38:06.200
(Jinpo's general, A'Wa)
I'll report you.

823
00:38:06.330 --> 00:38:07.730
I will definitely report you!

824
00:38:09.450 --> 00:38:10.250
Brother.

825
00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:12.730
All the prisoners here are from Jinpo.

826
00:38:12.770 --> 00:38:14.850
Which area are you from?

827
00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:17.080
I am A'Wa,

828
00:38:17.290 --> 00:38:19.600
the son of General A'Wu of Jinpo.

829
00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:21.160
I like soybean paste.
[*Homophone of "General"]

830
00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:22.730
You can dip onion in it.

831
00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:25.410
He is General A'Wa.

832
00:38:28.290 --> 00:38:29.160
General.

833
00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:35.370
General A'Wa.

834
00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:36.930
How did you get caught up here?

835
00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:38.810
I want to see Hua Liuli.

836
00:38:38.850 --> 00:38:40.370
She is a vicious woman.

837
00:38:41.850 --> 00:38:42.810
Princess Hua

838
00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:44.680
is not as vicious as you say she is.

839
00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:46.450
Yes, general.

840
00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:48.250
Don't be so gloomy.

841
00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:50.520
This prison is actually a good place.

842
00:38:50.930 --> 00:38:51.850
Yes.

843
00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:53.330
At least it's clean.

844
00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:54.680
Yes.

845
00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:56.520
What have you guys

846
00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:58.600
been through in this state?

847
00:39:09.450 --> 00:39:10.200
Yuansu.

848
00:39:10.970 --> 00:39:12.080
I asked you here

849
00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:14.040
to help me with the administration,

850
00:39:14.250 --> 00:39:15.290
not to drink tea

851
00:39:15.330 --> 00:39:16.560
and slack off.

852
00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:19.080
Father,

853
00:39:19.850 --> 00:39:21.000
you are still young.

854
00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:22.810
What do you mean by that?

855
00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:25.160
So don't expect too much from me.

856
00:39:25.410 --> 00:39:26.480
I'm still young.

857
00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:28.000
Nonsense.

858
00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:29.560
Since you are so idle,

859
00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:31.160
why don't you help me read the memorials

860
00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:32.330
and give me suggestions?

861
00:39:37.730 --> 00:39:39.730
If you ask for my opinion,

862
00:39:39.930 --> 00:39:41.040
I can only say that

863
00:39:41.730 --> 00:39:42.770
most of these memorials

864
00:39:42.890 --> 00:39:44.200
are full of nonsense.

865
00:39:44.930 --> 00:39:46.730
This is what you requested,

866
00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.160
for each person to
provide daily feedback.

867
00:39:49.410 --> 00:39:50.200
And now,

868
00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:53.160
they write every trivial matter

869
00:39:53.410 --> 00:39:54.770
in the memorial.

870
00:39:55.220 --> 00:39:56.160
Although the whole state

871
00:39:56.250 --> 00:39:57.020
has prospered

872
00:39:57.020 --> 00:39:58.450
under your rule

873
00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:00.480
and it's impossible for events
to happen every day,

874
00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:01.680
but these people

875
00:40:01.890 --> 00:40:03.560
can't even write a journal

876
00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:05.330
to flatter you.

877
00:40:05.450 --> 00:40:06.810
That's a problem of competence.

878
00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:08.160
Fine.

879
00:40:08.410 --> 00:40:09.600
Since you don't want to help,

880
00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:10.680
please leave.

881
00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:12.250
Don't be an eyesore here.

882
00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:13.290
All right.

883
00:40:13.410 --> 00:40:14.970
Then I'll go and monitor

884
00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:16.520
Yuanhao and Princess Hua.

885
00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:18.160
Wait.

886
00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:20.410
Do you have any other orders?

887
00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:27.330
Let Yuanhao

888
00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:30.080
and Hua Liuli

889
00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:31.600
handle it on their own

890
00:40:31.850 --> 00:40:33.330
since you don't want
to run for the election.

891
00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:34.640
As you said before,

892
00:40:34.850 --> 00:40:36.080
since you are not interested

893
00:40:36.207 --> 00:40:37.057
with Princess Hua,

894
00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:38.520
don't get involved.

895
00:40:39.410 --> 00:40:41.120
A'Wa, the general of Jinpo,

896
00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:42.640
has been captured here.

897
00:40:42.730 --> 00:40:44.330
Interrogate him.

898
00:40:47.250 --> 00:40:47.850
All right.

899
00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:51.290
Father.

900
00:40:52.810 --> 00:40:54.370
Rest when it's time to rest.

901
00:40:54.450 --> 00:40:55.730
If you don't want to read the memorials,

902
00:40:55.810 --> 00:40:57.200
just have them sent

903
00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:57.640
to me.

904
00:40:58.480 --> 00:40:59.600
I'll play chess with you another day.

905
00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:05.040
Miss.

906
00:41:05.770 --> 00:41:06.890
Miss.

907
00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:07.930
Miss.

908
00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:11.160
What now?

909
00:41:11.370 --> 00:41:12.450
I heard that...

910
00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:13.520
I heard that...

911
00:41:13.730 --> 00:41:14.770
I heard that...

912
00:41:14.850 --> 00:41:15.970
What is it?

913
00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:16.810
I heard that

914
00:41:16.850 --> 00:41:18.480
A'Wa has been taken to the State of Jin.

915
00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:19.250
That means

916
00:41:19.330 --> 00:41:21.200
the envoy meeting is about to begin.

917
00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:22.120
Yes.

918
00:41:24.930 --> 00:41:26.120
The queue at Prince Ying's shack

919
00:41:26.370 --> 00:41:28.000
is quite long.

920
00:41:28.250 --> 00:41:29.770
They are giving out free porridge.

921
00:41:29.890 --> 00:41:31.080
Even the non-refugees are queuing up.

922
00:41:31.330 --> 00:41:32.450
They call him big boss.

923
00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:34.480
Everyone praises him.

924
00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:35.850
Not only that,

925
00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:37.370
they speak ill of you everywhere.

926
00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:38.560
This is too much!

927
00:41:38.770 --> 00:41:40.600
We're obviously overpowered.

928
00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:42.770
Then he's really impressive.

929
00:41:43.410 --> 00:41:44.120
Miss.

930
00:41:44.370 --> 00:41:46.200
Why aren't you worried at all?

931
00:41:46.450 --> 00:41:47.890
What's the point?

932
00:41:57.600 --> 00:41:58.000
Done.

933
00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:05.560
Yuan Wei.

934
00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:07.520
Assist

935
00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:08.730
your delicate

936
00:42:08.810 --> 00:42:09.680
and beautiful master.

937
00:42:09.770 --> 00:42:10.560
All right.

938
00:42:19.740 --> 00:42:21.970
(Pretentious Hour)

939
00:42:21.970 --> 00:42:22.930
Hurry up.

940
00:42:31.410 --> 00:42:32.770
Brother.

941
00:42:33.370 --> 00:42:33.890
Brother.

942
00:42:33.970 --> 00:42:34.810
Nice to see you two.

943
00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:38.450
Wait.

944
00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:39.890
You two

945
00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:41.640
aren't being followed
by the soldiers, are you?

946
00:42:41.730 --> 00:42:43.520
No, brother.

947
00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:44.970
Don't worry, brother.

948
00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:45.810
We got rid

949
00:42:45.890 --> 00:42:46.600
of those soldiers

950
00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:48.080
a hundred thousand miles away.

951
00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:49.000
Good.

952
00:42:49.330 --> 00:42:50.450
Why do you look

953
00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:52.680
thinner than me?

954
00:42:52.890 --> 00:42:54.040
Brother.

955
00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:57.290
Is there anything to eat?

956
00:42:57.480 --> 00:42:58.330
Yes.

957
00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:01.770
Wait.

958
00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:03.890
This is the last one left.

959
00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:07.520
You two can have it.

960
00:43:15.250 --> 00:43:16.770
We were never able
